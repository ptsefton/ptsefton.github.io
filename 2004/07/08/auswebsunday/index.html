<h1> 
Ausweb 04, the neutrality of educational software 
</h1>
<h2>2004-07-08 </h2>

<p>Here's what interested me about the keynote speakers on day one of
AUSWEB 04. We had two good quality presenters with a hidden theme, the
'neutrality' of educational software.</p>
<p>First up was Murray Goldberg, founder of WebCT, now of Silicon Chalk
(<a href="http://ausweb.scu.edu.au/aw04/papers/edited/goldberg/Ausweb.ppt">available in power-bloody-point
only</a>,
but with speaker notes, which are an interesting read: &quot;Practice,
practice, practice&quot;). He talked (quickly!) about the history of WebCT
about which I have a few comments, and new tools for managing and
facilitating interaction, about which I will comment another time.</p>
<p>On his slides he calls WebCT a CMS, which had me confused. It's a
Content Management System? But no, he meant Course Management System.
These things are now commonly known as Learning Management Systems.
Apparently CMS is an archaic term.</p>
<p>I may be reading too much into this, but it seems like an acknowledgment
of the state of the art; typical Learning Management systems are not
really managing learning, they're managing courses – the course code,
the course title, lists of students, the course content, marks and so
on. A learning management system might <em>really</em> be like a quality
management system – a methodology rather than a software application.
Either that or Murray travels with a really old slide show.</p>
<p>In the question time at the end, when dealing with the idea that general
purpose tools can be used by 'bad' teachers to do 'bad' teaching more
efficiently, Murray talked about his goal of making his software
'neutral' regarding things like pedagogy. This is the bit that interests
me. What is this neutrality?</p>
<p>For a start neutral never means transparent - software colours anything,
even if only a light tint. Murray noted this himself, saying that his
Unix background had made WebCT flexible but maybe harder to use than
some other systems.</p>
<p>From a content management perspective, which is the bit that interests
me, the neutrality of both WebCT and Blackboard (and <a href="blog/2004/05/11/caddie">Caddie of
course</a>) with respect to content standards means
they tend to get used as a file system on line; the 'neutral' thing they
do is allow upload of any-old file in any-old format.</p>
<p>In a parallel universe, with a different kind of IT market, neutral
might mean you <em>only</em> let people put up web materials and not office
documents.</p>
<p>One technologist's neutral is another's reverse-gear.</p>
<p>My job involves compromising, or overcoming, or suppressing, the
neutrality of learning management systems by enabling an organisation to
set up publishing standards, and help their authors and editors to
create consistent, usable courseware, cheaply and quickly. To do this,
we have created a courseware management system that lives outside of the
Learning Management System - <a href="http://ausweb.scu.edu.au/aw04/papers/edited/sefton2/paper.html">my
paper</a>
explains some of the issues.</p>
<p>Sunday's second speaker, André Greenberry, Lieutenant Colonel, Staff
Officer Grade One, Flexible Delivery Development Headquarters Training
Technology, had lots of colour and movement to show, but there's <a href="http://ausweb.scu.edu.au/aw04/papers/edited/greenberry/paper.html">a
written
paper</a>
as well.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Colonel Greenberry demoed marvellous media-rich training
materials which I gather were created in Director, then showed us some
of the same kinds of materials in a new web based Learning Management
System. He mentioned that he did not have the control he wanted over
fonts and layout and so on. So the software is not neutral enough. The
Lieutenant Colonel does not want, I gather, to give all of his 69 staff
and assorted contractors free reign to change the font on a given page.
What he would need, though, would be a way to set the doctrine on
matters of layout and style; that is the software needs to be neutral
until an officer with enough authority orders it otherwise.</p>
<p>And André is interested in a lot more than the font - all the stuff he
showed us was driven by educational theory and Army culture and most
importantly by experienced instructional designers and trainers; I'm
interested in how we can make software that is configurable at <em>those</em>
levels. I quote from the
<a href="http://ausweb.scu.edu.au/aw04/papers/edited/greenberry/paper.html">paper</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Understanding the science and art underpinning the development of
eLearning is a prerequisite for the design of a quality product. But
alas, many eLearning products are being designed oblivious of the
requisite science and art. There are a plethora of computer based
learning packages that simply focus on delivering huge amounts of
content and contravene basic instructional design principals.
Information presentation does not constitute learning. So it is that
eReading, eBoring and eSleeping products are dissolving the 'learning'
ideals of eLearning. It is becoming more and more apparent that the
principals of learning are being subsumed by the eLearning delivery
medium.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which I think, is along the lines of what I am saying about the
'neutrality' of Learning Management Systems - easy to sell, more or less
easy to use, but nothing to do with learning.</p>

<h1> 
Mobile future. Clear as MUD 
</h1>
<h2>2004-11-08 </h2>

<p>The incredible Russell Beattie is
<a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008146.html">thinking</a> <em>hard</em>
about mobile telephones and what they're going to mean.</p>
<p><a href="update:_russell_points_out_that_he_%3Ca_class=">wrote_about_mobiles_and_muds</a>_recently._i_must_have_seen_that_and_forgotten._see_the_comments_at_his_site.&quot;&gt;Update:
Russell points out that he <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008025.html">wrote about mobiles and
MUDs</a> recently. I
must have seen that and forgotten. See the
<a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008146.html#1011439">comments</a>
at his site.</p>
<p>Me, I sympathize, although for now I'm happy with the Nokia 5210 (or is
it a 5120?) my girlfriend discarded. But the young people really like
these mobiles. The aforementioned girlfriend has a girlfriend who'd be
not a day over 38 and she's <em>always</em> texting. Not to mention the
thirteen yearold niece, who apparently prefers SMS, and MSN to voice,
even to face to face.</p>
<p>Me, I've been playing with Linux. I can now SSH from anywhere (work,
anyway) to the computer I bought from my previous employer for $25 and
type at it in my rusty, faltering Unix. So much more satisfying than all
that gauche windowesque gesticulating with the mouse. Linux and I know
each other so well it can finish my sentences (hit Tab and it guesses
what you mean, just like a modern mobile works out what you are typing).</p>
<p>See where I'm going with this?</p>
<p>While Russell points out that watching <em>Finding Nemo</em> on a telephone is
pretty cool, I wonder if maybe the young person's preference for txt
would extend to user interface. What does it mean when I type '57' on my
mobile keypad? Is it 'jp' or is it 'ls' the Unix directory-listing
command? And the N-orth E-ast S-outh W-est of a text based
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_%28disambiguation%29">adventure</a>
game would still work as M D P W.</p>
<p>(And wouldn't any committed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi">vi user</a>
be happy with an even more modal interface?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>vi can frustrate new users, because it is a modal editor. A modal
editor (or any modal program) assigns different meanings to buttons or
keystrokes depending on which editing mode is active.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>)</p>
<p>I'm not sure what Russell's application, the one that will get him out
of his pyjamas and into the boardroom, will look like. But maybe it will
be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD">MUDlike</a>. I'd try to explain MUD's
here but I can't. If you don't know follow the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD">link</a> to the Wikepedia and set aside
a few hours...</p>
<p>(Interestingly that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD">Wikipedia
article</a> asserts that &quot;Still others
<a href="muds">MUDs</a>, especially those which are based on MOOs, are used in
distance education or to allow for virtual conferences.&quot; But sadly it
provides no links.)</p>
<p>Maybe the killer mobile app has a text based interface, and maybe it's a
sort of MUDlike projection of meatspace into the virtual realm, a place
you can wander about like an adept Systems Administrator using only the
keypad with some very smart predictive software and a very well chosen
vocabulary, chatting, fighting, making lurve, and leaving messages on
the walls.</p>
<p>Communicontent.</p>
<p>One of Russell's correspondents, commentors, whatever,
<a href="http://the.taoofmac.com/space/blog/2004-11-07.13%3A17">says</a> &quot;The
limited UI, however, forces us to classify that user data and its
dependencies, and to do that meta-data is essential.&quot;</p>
<p>I dunno about this metadata stuff or nothin', but I don't think
'limited' is the way to think about it. If it's good enough for a
teenager to make her preferred medium of communication then maybe it's
<em>empowering</em>.</p>

Don&#39;t just blog this

<h2>2004-06-04 </h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Geeks like me are fine with writing in Emacs, but lots of people seem
to like writing in word processors, and as of this week, I think that
any word processor without a &quot;Blog This&quot; button is just broken.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Geeks like who? <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/03/26/OpenOffice">Geeks like Tim
Bray</a>.
Other people prefer
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/news/zenclavier_1299.html">vi</a> over Emacs, and
James Tauber thinks <a href="http://www.jtauber.com/blog/2004/04/05/eclipse_is_next_emacs">Eclipse will be the next
contender</a>.
I prefer to write prose in a word processor, but then I'm not a geek.</p>
<p>Here are my thoughts on blogging from a word processor, and how this
might work with Atom, which <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/06/02/AtomMeetingReport#p-22">does not look promising at this
stage</a>.</p>
<p>I like Tim Bray's idea of the &quot;blog this&quot; button, but I think we can do
even better than that. As of today <em>I</em> think any word processor without
a</p>
<ul>
<li>make me an XHTML version of this content,</li>
<li>check with me how much metadata I would like to add,</li>
<li>help me provide an abstract by pulling out the first paragraph or
two,</li>
<li>stick it in the corporate content store,</li>
<li>keep the original so it can be re-edited,</li>
<li>check if I want all of it — or a short bloggish summary — to appear
in a blog,</li>
<li>ask if I want a PDF rendition,</li>
<li>and work out what distribution it should have,</li>
</ul>
<p>button is just broken. Two clicks to just blog an item as is, a few more
to slot it into a knowledge base where it can find others like itself on
the basis of more than just the posting date. If I'm writing minutes
from a meeting I probably want to store the full minutes and blog a
summary but also be able to search by document type or by meeting. A
good general purpose content management system can run a blog, but a
blogging system is a just a web logging system. I want both.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">the OpenOffice.org application suite</a>,
about which geek Tim Bray is talking in his post, my button looks easy
enough to add, given a place to store the content and run the blog and
so on. OpenOffice already has a nice way of keeping all its bits and
pieces including images in one place, a zip file. It also has a barely
acceptable export to HTML, which can be <a href="http://tidy.sourceforge.net/">tidied to make it into
XHTML</a>. I am looking to see if OpenOffice
can be scripted to add PDF, and HTML stuff to this container so it can
be thrown around as a single object.</p>
<p>In MS Word the problem is somewhat different. From Word 2000 onwards
there is a 'Save as Web' feature that gives you all of your content in
an accessible format, including an HTML-ish version that's relatively
easy to transform into XML, from where you can transform it easily to
XHTML based on your styles. You even get web-ready versions of all your
images and other component objects. But Word lacks an omnibus format
that bundles them all together (yes I know about the Microsoft download
that is supposed to do this but it doesn't work for me), and a built in
PDF renderer. <a href="http://www.teratext.com.au/get/page/directory/browser">The Ace scripting language has round-trip-functions for
Word HTML</a> that I
helped design. See this <a href="http://www.planetmarkup.com/xmlarena/xap/Thursday/WordtoXML.pdf">presentation in PDF I gave with Timothy
Arnold-Moore</a>.</p>
<p>The bad news is that at this stage there is no way to do build this
button and use Atom to add it to a blog without multiple posts. Tim Bray
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/06/02/AtomMeetingReport#p-22">again</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A crucial decision point seems to be whether you try to package up
multiple pieces in one message, or not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Atom doesn't let you package multiple pieces in one message then I
won't use it for posting to a repository. I don't understand all the
technical stuff involved here — I naively thought of using a zipped
bundle for multi part entries — but I don't want to have to manage
multiple calls to a repository to do what should be a single
transaction, and then have to manage rollback if something goes wrong.
Been there.</p>

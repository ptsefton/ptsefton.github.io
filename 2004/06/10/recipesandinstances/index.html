Recipes and Instances 
</h1>
<h2>2004-06-10 </h2>

<p>Back in the early nineteen eighties, it was known that we would all use
our personal computers to store recipes. Even though it's the <a href="http://kunstler.com/">twenty
first century now, and we don't have to be modern any
more</a> we now keep recipes on the computer at our
house! Usually ones we have sought out on the web, and there's no system
to it yet. I'm interested in <a href="blog/2004/06/02/recipe_schema">systematizing this
storage</a>, but beyond the recipe, I want
to remember the instance, the <em>meal</em> via a sort of review.</p>
<p>Readers who are less afflicted with <em>creeping gourmetism</em> than I, or who
have never used a video camera to see how they'd look as a TV chef may
want to avert their gazes.</p>
<p>For a few years I have been poorly maintaining a diary, which contains
entries <em>like</em> this, from when we lived out of town:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2001-12-31</p>
<p>Found a snake skin in the sewing garage. Yet to measure it, maybe
70cm. Guess it's a python like the others.</p>
<p>Dinner was a BBQ - tandoori chicken. Prawns (big ones 6 = 500g) in
pineapple juice, fish sauce and coriander (too much fish sauce). Kofta
meatballs with mint, cumin etc. Grilled veggies. Salad. Kids got
extravagant sundaes. Pineapple, mango, ice cream, strawberry topping,
little chocolate bits, etc. A didn't get half an inch into his, too
tired. Remainder was for smoothies.</p>
<p>S and Pt watched Swordfish and failed to eat either our cheese platter
or our special sundaes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So that's what they do in regional ostraya on New Year's Eve. Sad, but
as far as I recall, true.</p>
<p>There are recipes implied here and there is a kind of review, but I
can't remember where I might find the recipes again and whether we
guessed them, made them up or had them thrust upon us. How much is too
much?</p>
<p>If I had marked up the recipes with a link or a reference to a book or
magazine, then the next time I come into possession of some big prawns,
I could search on my own culinary history to find a recipe <em>and</em> my
comments, and I could go easy on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nam_pla">nam
pla</a>. I could also have typed in
what I thought of it all as well.</p>
<p>And, if web publishing software and/or practice can support a few simple
conventions for reviewing a recipe as well as publishing one, such as
those I proposed for recipe markup <a href="blog/2004/06/02/recipe_schema">last
time</a> then we have a new niche for search
in the blogging world. Little Technorati-style talk bubbles could pop up
next to ingredients to elaborate. How does <a href="http://www.sos-childrensvillages.org/cgi-bin/sos/jsp/lookInside.do?cat=%2Fculture_and_tradition&amp;ed=34054&amp;lang=en&amp;nav=2.1&amp;site=ZZ&amp;v=13613">&quot;Yes, you can eat Pumpkin
leaves, we found out from a visitor to our new inner city place&quot; this
recipe</a>
work, what with pumpkin leaves at $30/kg so you need to substitute bok
choy? Please, make this, write up the results, and invent all the
machinery to let me know automatically. You can have some of our feral
pumpkin leaves if you like.</p>

<h1> 
What is Content Management? 
</h1>
<h2>2004-12-08 </h2>

<p>Ask Google: what is content management</p>
<p>Web definitions for Content Management Sometimes called 'knowledge
management'. Content management is often used to refer to the process of
handling information presented in either a buy- or sell-side catalogs,
including part numbers, descriptions and unit size. It also refers to
the process of capturing, storing, sorting, codifying,
integrating,updating and protecting any and all information.</p>
<p>www.isourceonline.com/research/glossary/index.asp - Definition in context</p>
<p>Hmmm.</p>
<p>The part about the process of capturing, storing, sorting, codifying,
integrating,updating and protecting any and all information, is about
right. I'm not too sure about the part number stuff. And where I come
from Content Management and Knowledge Management are emphatically not
the same thing.</p>
<p>Let's look further down the page. The first couple of hits are for
people trying to sell you stuff:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft Content Management Server: Home Vignette - Content
Management and Portal Solutions</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then we're into the confusing world of open source content
management.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PostNuke : Navigation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No luck there, although I am greeeted with 'Welcome Stranger' and can
apparently win an XBox, (whatever that is :-).</p>
<p>Followed by, not too far down by James Robertson's company (James was in
the same session as me at Open Publish this year), where we can click a
few times to find this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Content management systems support the creation, management,
distribution, publishing, and discovery of corporate information. Also
known as 'web content management' (WCM), these systems typically focus
on online content targeted at either a corporate website or intranet</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right. But there is more to think about than the corporate world, and
the web even if that is what Content Management is coming to mean.</p>
<p>You know what I think Content Management is?</p>
<p>First of all what is content?</p>
<p>I like to take the classic Knowledge Management hierarchy, which has (at
least) three strata:</p>
<p>Knowledge
Information
Data</p>
<p>And I split it into the human and the computer view:</p>
<p>Human               Computer
================================
Knowledge     (does_not_compute)
Information       Content
(ugh)             Data</p>
<p>This is an approximation only, but content in this simple model is the
computational analogue of something that a human can treat as
information. That is, it is structured in some way to make it
comprehensible, digestible.</p>
<p>My definition of content: Labeled, linkable data.</p>
<p>Here's a few personal observations about content management and related
terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Knowledge Management is a process, not a piece of software (a
lifestyle, man), like a Quality Management System.</li>
<li>A Content Management System might be implemented in a computer
program, but it does not make you and your organization know stuff.
People have to construct knowledge for themselves.</li>
<li>A Knowledge Management System is what you do to manipulate people so
they construct stuff out of their interactions with each other, and
with content, in that order.</li>
<li>Content is all your data, organized (labeled, linkable) so computers
can make the leap between the mention of your name here and your
salary details there so the CEO can decide that you are an important
asset and give you an encouragement award. Or not, as the case may
be.</li>
<li>Content Management is the business and/or computational system than
ties all your labeled, linkable data together.</li>
<li>One of the biggest impediments to content management is the often
impermeable membrane between field-structured (your
spreadsheetesque, relational-databaseish stuff) and
hierarchically-structured (XML, HTML documents or good quality word
processing documents) data. Programming tools that map SQL to XML
may promise to close the gap, but I think the techniques to find the
right kind of mappings to do really transcendent Content Management,
Content Management that really helps people construct new knowledge,
are just emerging. My tip here: watch what Jon Udell does. Jon is
doing stuff like making segments of video linkable and talking about
open document formats which will make labeling and linking work
across organizational boundaries.</li>
</ul>

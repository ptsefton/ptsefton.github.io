<h1> 
Agile Teaching (and Learning) 
</h1>
<h2>2004-12-23 </h2>

<p>I have been thinking for years about features for content management
applications, and for online learning software, which eventually got me
thinking about features for teachers. Not the features the teachers need
in their software (and not the size of the teacher's nose), but the
features the <em>learners</em> (remember them?) need in their teachers. So,
since I'm going to be a <em>Senior Research Technologist in Flexible
Learning Systems</em> come 2005-01-01, I thought I'd better do some
research, starting with asking our local experts.</p>
<p>A more detailed post on &quot;Teacher Features&quot; will be forthcoming when I
get my head around it and talk to a few more people, and read the stuff
they recommend to me, but I'd like to report on an insight I got from
talking to one expert online educator today on the phone.</p>
<p>I've asked a few people about &quot;Teacher Features&quot; but <a href="http://www.usq.edu.au/users/reushle/">Shirley
Reushle</a> is so far the quickest
with a usable quote, which I was too slow to write down verbatim (well I
tried, but now I can't read it).</p>
<p>Key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Onine teachers need a strong theoretical background in contemporary
pedagogical theory.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>And they have to understand constructivism, what it means to work
with interaction, collaboration, activities, empathy.</li>
</ul>
<p>We talked about the teachers, and then a little about software to
support them, and the small role that content plays in successful online
learning (but I still think it's <a href="http://ptsefton.com/blog/2004/12/03/e_publishing_worthwhile">worth looking after the content
well</a>).</p>
<p>I have recently formed the opinion that teachers like Shirley could get
people to learn under wet cement, but when I put it to her that a decent
features set in the teacher would be more important than features in
software, she was quick to reply that the software needed to be
seamless, responsive and flexible. And if it wasn't it would <em>not be
used</em>. (But I've heard Shirley talk about how she has used the far from
seamless patchwork of tools we used to provide at NextEd to deliver
educational experiences with transcendent results).</p>
<p>Anyway, the point of this piece is that after a few minutes of talking
to Shirley, the phrase &quot;Agile Teaching&quot; popped into my head, as she
began talking about stuff like 'content free' courses where you abandon
the planned content and take the group off in another direction, and the
importance of continual evaluation rather than the current view of
evaluation as a somewhat embarrassing growth on the outside of a course,
amongst other things.</p>
<p>I was seeing parallels to Agile Programming Methodologies, the most
famous of which is Extreme Programming, a useful set of tools for some
kinds of software development with a name that still makes me cringe.
The most striking similarity between Shirley's approach to online
education and the XP approach is the way an undertaking is driven like a
vehicle, with frequent, small course corrections; rather than a
delusional commitment to pointing the nose in <em>that</em> direction and
pressing the accelerator, hoping to arrive in a few months time. There's
a lot about this in the <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PlanningExtremeProgramming">Planning Extreme
Programming</a> book.</p>
<p>Later: Asked Google about &quot;Agile Teaching&quot;.</p>
<p>Number on hit is a <a href="http://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~hwchun/agile/">page on &quot;The Agile Teaching/Learning
Methodology&quot;</a> by one Dr Andy
Chun that says pretty much what flashed through my head when I talked to
Shirley, (and Dr Chun even managed to remember to include the learners):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It turns out the software development process, in many ways, is
similar to the teaching process. It involves multiple parties with
different objectives (sometimes conflicting), a very tight schedule to
get things done, a fixed deadline, limited resources and a lot of
expected/unexpected changes along the way. The process requires
detailed planning/scheduling, tracking and management with continuous
assessment and feedback from all parties. Getting a software project
done correctly and on time is not easy. Making a sure a course is
taught properly and on schedule can also be a challenge sometimes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I liked the discussion of extreme:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By extreme, I mean if something is good, we go to the extreme and do
it constantly. If giving feedback to students on their learning is
good, we should give feedback each class. Conversely, if getting
feedback from students is good, we should allow students to give
feedback whenever they want. If students learn better by teaching,
they should be allowed to teach and share their knowledge constantly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a part-time computer programmer who has used and profited from agile
programming, and worked to support teaching and learning systems I find
this an interesting idea. I'm not saying that a young, somewhat
cult-like, programming methodology could add much to education theory,
just that it may be a good way to explain to our programmers what our
teachers are doing and help us construct more flexible, responsive
software; the sort we'd like to use to run <em>our</em> knowledge-building
projects.</p>

Letter of resignation 
</h1>
<h2>2015-01-07 </h2>

<blockquote>
<p>to: The boss</p>
<p>cc: Another senior person, HR</p>
<p>date: 2014-12-10</p>
<p>Dear &lt;boss&gt;,</p>
<p>As I discussed with you last week, I have accepted a position with
UTS, starting Feb 9th 2015, and I resign my position with UWS. My last
day will be Feb 6th 2015.</p>
<p>Regards, Peter</p>
<p>Dr PETER SEFTON Manager, eResearch, Office of the Deputy
Vice-Chancellor (Research &amp; Development) University of Western Sydney</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anticipated FAQ:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>What?</strong> eResearch Support Manager - more or less the same gig as
I've had at <a href="http://uws.edu.au">UWS</a>, in a tech-focussed uni with a
bigger team, dedicated
<a href="http://www.uts.edu.au/future-students/design-architecture-and-building/facilities/research-facilities/data-arena-prototype#the-data-arena">visualisation</a>
service and <a href="https://eresearch.uts.edu.au/hpc/">HPC</a> staff, an
actual budget and mostly within a few city blocks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Why <a href="http://uts.edu.au">UTS?</a></strong> A few reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There was a job going, I thought I'd see if they liked me. They
did. I already knew some of the eResearch team there. I'm
confident we will be good together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's a continuing position, rather than the five-year,
more-than-half-over contract I was on, not that I'm planning to
settle down for the rest of my working life as an eResearch
manager or anything.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The physical concentration should be conducive to Research
Bazaar <a href="http://resbaz.tumblr.com/about">#resbaz</a> activities
such as <a href="http://resbaz.tumblr.com/post/74791203771/join-us-for-hacky-hour">Hacky
Hour</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p><strong>But what about the travel!!!!?</strong> It will be 90 minutes laptop time
each way on a comfy, reasonably cheap and fairly reliable train
service with almost total mobile internet coverage, with a few
hundred metres walking on either end. That's a change from 35-90
minutes each way depending on what campus(es) I was heading for that
day and the mode of transport, which unfortunately was mostly motor
vehicle. I do <em>not</em> like adding yet another car to Sydney's M4, M7
or M5, despite what I said in my UWS staff
<a href="http://uws.edu.au/auws/arounduws_home_page/auws_archives/2014/july/staff_snapshot_peter_sefton">snapshot</a>.
I think I'll be fine with the train. If not, oops. Anyway, there are
inner-Sydney family members and mates I'll see more of if only for
<a href="https://plus.google.com/111155206947420479345/about?gl=au&amp;hl=en">lunch</a>.</p>

<p>When the internets stop working the view is at its best. OK, apart
from the tunnel and the cuttings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What's the dirt on UWS?</strong> It's not about UWS, I've had a great
time there, learned how to be an eResearch manager, worked on some
exciting <a href="http://uws.edu.au/eresearch/home/projects">projects</a>, made
some friends, and I'll be leaving behind an established, experienced
eResearch team to continue the work. I'm sorry to be going. I'd work
there again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Why did you use this mode of announcement?</strong> I was <a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2014-resign-msu.html">inspired
by</a> Titus Brown, a
few weeks a go.</p>

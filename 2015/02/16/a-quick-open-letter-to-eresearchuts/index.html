<h1> 
A quick open letter to eResearch@UTS 
</h1>
<h2>2015-02-16 </h2>

<p>2015-02-17, from a tent at the University of Melbourne</p>
<p>Hi team,</p>
<p>Thanks for a great first week last week and thanks for the lunch Peter
Gale - I think I counted 12 of us around the table. I thought the week
went well, and I actually got to help out with a couple of things, but
you'll all be carrying most of the load for a little while yet while I
figure out where the toilets are, read through those delightful
directives, policies and procedures that are listed in the induction
pack, and try to catch up with all the work that's already going on and
the systems you have in place. All of you, be sure to let me know if
there's something I should be doing to start pulling my weight.</p>
<p>As you know, I have immediately nicked-off to Melbourne for a few days.
Thought I might explain what that's about.</p>
<p>I am at the Research Bazaar conference,
#<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23resbaz">Resbaz</a>.</p>
<h1>What's a resbaz?</h1>
<p>The <a href="http://melbourne.resbaz.edu.au/conference">site says</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Research Bazaar Conference (#ResBaz) aims to kick-start a
training programme in Australia assuring the next generation of
researchers are equipped with the digital skills and tools to make
their research better.</p>
<p>This event builds on the successful Doctoral Training programmes by
research councils in the UK [1] and funding agencies in the USA [2].
We are also looking to borrow the chillaxed vibe of events like the
O’Reilly Science ‘Foo Events’ [3].</p>
<h2>So what exactly is ResBaz?</h2>
<p>ResBaz is two kinds of events in one:</p>
<ol>
<li>ResBaz is an academic training conference (i.e. think of this
event as a giant Genius Bar at an Apple store), where research
students and early career researchers can come to acquire the
digital skills (e.g. computer programming, data analysis, etc.)
that underpin modern research. Some of this training will be
delivered in the ‘hands-on’ workshop style of Mozilla’s global
‘Software Carpentry’ bootcamps.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can get hands-on support like at an Apple Store’s Genius Bar!</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>ResBaz is a social event where researchers can come together to
network, make new friends, and form collaborations. We’re even
trying to provide a camping site on campus for those researchers
who are coming on their own penny or just like camping (dorm rooms
at one of the Colleges will be a backup)! We have some really fun
activities planned around the event, from food trucks to tent BoFs
and watching movies al fresco!</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>It's also an ongoing research-training / eResearch rollout program at
Melbourne Uni.</p>
<h1>But what are you doing there Petie?</h1>
<p>On Monday I did three main things apart from the usual conference
networking, meeting people stuff.</p>
<h2>Soaked up the atmosphere, observed how the thing is run, and talked to people about how to run eResearch training programs</h2>
<p>David Flanders wants us to run a similar event in Sydney, I think that's
a good idea, he and I talked about how to get this kind of program
funded internally and what resources you need to make it happen.</p>
<p>Arna from Swinburne told me about a Resbaz-like model at Berkeley where
they use part-time postdocs to drive eResearch uptake. This is a bit
different from the Melbourne uni approach of working with postgrads:</p>

<h2>Attended the NLTK training session</h2>
<p>This involves working through a series of text-processing exercises in
an online Python shell, <a href="http://ipython.org/">iPython</a>. I'm really
interested in this one, not just 'cos of my extremely rusty PhD in
something resembling computational linguistics, but because of the
number of different researchers from different disciplines who will be
able to use this for text-mining, text processing and text
characterisation.</p>
<p>Jeff, can you please let the Intersect snap-deploy team know about
<a href="https://resbaz.cloud.edu.au/">DIT4C</a> - which lets you create a kind of
virtualised computer lab for workshops, and, I guess, for real work, via
some Docker voodoo. (Jeff Christiansen, is the UTS eResearch Analyst,
supplied by our eResearch partner Intersect).</p>
<h2>Met with Shuttleworth Fellow Peter Murray-Rust and the head of Mozilla's science lab Kaitlin Thaney</h2>
<p>We wanted to talk about <a href="https://github.com/scholarlyhtml">Scholarly
HTML</a>. How can we get scholarship to
be <em>of</em> the web, in rich content-minable semantic markup rather than
just <em>barely-on</em> the web. Even just simple things like linking authors
names to their identifiers would be a huge improvement over the current
identity guessing games we play with PDFs and low-quality bibliographic
metadata.</p>
<p>Kaitlin asked PMR and me where we should start with this, where would
the benefits be most apparent, and the the uptake most enthusiastic?
It's sad but the obvious benefits of HTML (like, say being able to read
an article on a mobile phone) are not enough to change the scholarly
publishing machine.</p>
<p>We've been working on this for a long time, and we know that getting
mainstream publisher uptake is almost impossible - but we think it's
worth visiting the Open Educational Resources movement and looking at
textbooks and course materials, where the audience want interactive
eBooks, and rich materials (even if they're packaged as apps, HTML is
still the way to build them). There's also a lot opportunity with NGO
and university reports where impact and reach are important, and with
the reproducible-research crowd who want to do things the <em>right</em> way.</p>
<p>I think there are some great opportunities for UTS in this space, as we
have Australia's biggest stable of Open Access journals, a great basis
on which to explore new publishing models and delivery mechanisms.</p>
<p>I put an idea to Kaitlin which might result in a really useful new tool.
She's got the influence at Mozilla and can mobilise and army of coders.
I hope there's more to report on that.</p>
<p>Kaitlin also knows how to do flattery:</p>

<h1>TODO</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Need to talk to Deb Verhoeven from Deakin about the new
<a href="https://github.com/ozmeka">Ozmeka</a> project, an open collaboration
to adapt the humanities-focussed Omeka respository software for
working-data repositories for a variety of research disciplines. So
far we have UWS and UTS contributing to the project, but we'd love
other Australian and global collaborators.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find out how to use NLTK to do named-entity recognition / semantic
tagging on stuff like species and common-names for animals,
specifically fish, for a
<a href="https://projects.ands.org.au/id/MODC13">project</a> we have running at
UTS.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This project takes a thematic approach to building a data
collection, selecting data from UTS research relating to water to
build a ‘Data Hub of Australian Research into Marine and Aquatic
Ecocultures’ (Dharmae). UTS produces a range of research involving
water across multiple disciplines: concerning water as a resource,
habitat, environment, or cultural and migratory medium. The
concept of ‘ecocultures’ will guide collection development which
acknowledges the interdependence of nature and culture, and
recognises that a multi-disciplinary approach is required to
produce transformational research. Rather than privilege a
particular discipline or knowledge system (e.g. science, history,
traditional indigenous knowledge, etc), Dharmae will be an open
knowledge arena for research data from all disciplines, with the
aim of supporting multi-disciplinary enquiry and provoking
cross-disciplinary research questions.</p>
<p>Dharmae will be seeded with two significant data collections, a
large oral history project concerning the Murray Darling Basin,
and social science research examining how NSW coastal residents
value the coast. These collections will be linked to related
external research data collections such as those on TERN, AODN,
and, thanks to the generous participation of indigenous
Australians in both studies, to the State Library of NSW
indigenous data collections. Dharmae will continue to develop
beyond the term of this project.</p>

<p>Make sure Steve from Melbourne meets people who can help him solve
his RAM problem by showing him how to access the NeCTAR cloud and
HPC services.</p>

<p>There have been some adjustments to the authorship on this presentation,
Peter Bugeia was on the abstract but didn’t end up contributing to the
presentation, whereas Katrina Trewin withdrew her name from the proposal
for a while, but successfully deployed the Farms to Freeways collection
and decided to come back in to the fold. The notes here are written in
the first person, to be delivered in this instance by Peter Sefton but
they come from all of the authors, portions of the script were developed
by Sharyn Wise and Peter Sefton for an internal presentation at UTS.</p>
<h3>Abstract as submitted</h3>
<p>The Ozmeka project is an Australian open source project to extend the
Omeka repository system. Our aim is to support Open Scholarship, Open
Science, and Cultural Heritage via repository software than can manage a
wide range of Research (and Open) Data, both Open and access-restricted,
providing rich repository services for the gathering, curation and
publishing of diverse data sets. The Ozmeka project places a great deal
of importance in <em>integrating with external systems</em> , to ensure that
research data is linked to its context, and high quality identifiers are
used for as much metadata as possible. This will include links to the
‘traditional’ staples of the Open Repositories conference series,
publications repositories, and to the growing number of institutional
and discipline research data repositories.</p>
<p>In this presentation we will take a critical look at how the Omeka
system, extended with Ozmeka plugins and themes can be used to manage
(a) a large cross disciplinary archive of research data about
water-resources (b) an ethno-historiography built around a published
book and (c) for managing large research data sets in and scientific
institute, and talk about how this work paves the way for eResearch and
repository support teams to supply similar services to researchers in a
wide variety of fields. This work intended to reduce the cost of and
complexity of creating new research data repository systems.</p>
<h3>Slightly different scope now</h3>
<p>I will be talking about Dharmae, the database of water-resources-themed
research data, the project to put the book data into Omeka took a
different turn and the scientific data repository is still being
developed.</p>
<p><img alt=" " src="http://ptsefton.com/2015/06/11/2111/img1.jpg"/>   ### How does this presentation fit in to the conference?  Which Conference Themes are we touching on?  -   Supporting Open Scholarship, Open Science, and Cultural Heritage</p>

<img alt=" " src="http://ptsefton.com/2015/06/11/2111/img2.jpg"/>   
<p>What’s Omeka?  We like to call Omeka the “Wordpress of repositories”  It’s a PHP application which is easy to install and get up and running
and yes – it is a ‘repository’, it lets you upload digital objects,
describe them with Dublin Core Metadata, and no, it’s not perfect.</p>
<img alt=" " src="http://ptsefton.com/2015/06/11/2111/img3.jpg">
<p>The Perfect Repository?</p>
<p>So lets talk about this phrase “the perfect repository”. I have been following Jason Scott at the Internet archive (who would make a great keynote speaker for this conference, by the way
and his work on rescuing and making available cultural heritage such as computer-related
ephemera and programs for obsolete computing and gaming platforms. He
uses the phrase “Perfect is the enemy of done” and talks about how
making some tradeoffs and compromises and then <em>just doing it</em> mean that
stuff, you know, actually gets done that otherwise wouldn’t.</p>
<p>No, we’re not calling Omeka “third best”, but one of the points of this
talk is that instead of waiting for or trying to build the ‘perfect’
research data repository Omeka is a low-barrier-to-entry, cheap way to
build some kinds of working-data-repositories or data-publishing
websites. I have talked to quite a few people who say they have looked
at Omeka and decided that it is too simple, too limited for whatever
project they were doing. Indeed, it does have some limitations; the two
big ones are that it does not handle access control at all and it has no
approval workflow, at least not in this version.</p>

Good</a></p>
<p><img alt="The Portland Common Data Model Omeka more-or-less implements a subset of the Portland Common Data Model, which I was introduced to yesterday in the Fedora workshop,
although as I just mentioned it is not strong on Access control, having
only a published/unpublished flag on items." src="http://ptsefton.com/2015/06/11/2111/img4.jpg"/></p>
<img alt=" " src="http://ptsefton.com/2015/06/11/2111/img5.jpg"/> 
<p>Why Omeka? We’ll come back to this – but the ability to do Linked Data was one of the main attractions of Omeka. We had to add some code to make the relations appear like this, and easier to apply than I the ‘trunk’ version of Omeka 2.x but that development was not hard or expensive, compared to what It might have cost on top of other
repository systems with more complex application stacks. Another</p>
<p>(Note – if you look at the current version of Dharmae, the item
relations will appear a little differently, as not all the Ozmeka
enhanced code has been rolled out).</p>
<img alt=" Australian national data service (ANDS) funded project … to  kick-start a major open data collection " src="http://ptsefton.com/2015/06/11/2111/img6.jpg"/> 
<p>I’m going to give you a quick backgrounder on our project by way of introduction: ANDS approached us with a funding opportunity to create an open data collection. Many of you will be familiar with the frustrations of funding rules : our constraint was that we were not allowed to
develop software, although we could adapt it.</p>
<p>The UTS team put the word out for publishable research data collections
but got little response. Then, thanks to the library eScholarship team,
Sharyn met Professor Heather Goodall and Jodi Frawley, who had data from
a large Oral History project on the impacts of water management on
stakeholders in the Murray Darling Basin – called Talking Fish.</p>
<p>And they had had the amazing foresight – the foresight of the historian-
to obtain informed consent to publically archive the interview data.</p>
<img alt=" Field science in MDB (from Dharmae) " src="http://ptsefton.com/2015/06/11/2111/img7.jpg"/>  
<p>In the image above MDB means he Murray Darling Basin, a big, long river system with hardly any water in it.  First up I’ll talk about Dharmae. was conceived as a multi-disciplinary data hub themed around water related research, with the “ecocultures”
concept intended to flag that we welcome scientific data contributors
(ecological or otherwise), as well as cultural data. Because they are
equally crucial if we want to research to have an impact on the world.</p>
<p>This position is also supported in the literature of the
intergovernmental science policy community and environmental
sustainability and resilience research.</p>
<p>One paper expressed it this way - for research to have a transformative
impact, its not simply more knowledge that we need, but different types
of knowledge.</p>
<p>The literature emphasizes the need for improved connectivity between
knowledge systems: those applied to researching the natural world, such
as science, and those that investigate socio-cultural practices such as
social sciences, history and particularly also indigenous knowledge.</p>
<p>But because these different knowledge systems each come with their own
practices and terminologies, we have an interesting information science
problem:</p>
<p>How to support data deposit and discovery by users from all disciplines?</p>
<img alt=" Linked data & disambiguation " src="http://ptsefton.com/2015/06/11/2111/img8.jpg"/> 
<p>Essentially by using linked data. We extended the open source repository Omeka by allowing all named entities (like, places, people, species&quot;/&gt; to be linked to an authoritative source of truth.  Lets take location – it is one of the obvious correspondences between
scientific and cultural data..</p>
<p>That still doesn’t mean its an easy thing to link on. Place names are
rarely unique as we see Kendell noticing above.</p>
<p>But by using authoritative sources, like Geonames, we can disambiguate
place names, and better still we can derive their coordinates.</p>
<p>Now we want users of Dharmae who are interested in finding data by
location to access it in the way that makes sense to them – and that may
not be name.</p>
<img alt=" Lower Darling/Anabranch " src="http://ptsefton.com/2015/06/11/2111/img9.jpg"/>  
<p>In Dharmae readers can search by place name or they can use a map.  Here is one of 12 study regions from the Talking Fish data, showing the Lower Darling and Anabranch above Murray Sunset National Park.
We georeferenced these regions using a Geonode map server, but we have
superimposed the researchers hand-drawn map as a layer on top to
preserve the sense of human scale interaction</p>
<p>You can click through from here to read or listen to the oral histories
completed in this region, look at photos or investigate the species
identified by participants.</p>
<p>You can also search by Indigenous language Community if you prefer.</p>
<p>How else could this be useful?</p>
<img alt=" Lower Darling/Anabranch: " src="http://ptsefton.com/2015/06/11/2111/img10.jpg"/>  
<p>It just so happens that we also have a satellite remote sensing dataset that corresponds reasonably well to this region above the national park.  It shows the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index for the region or the vegetation change over the decade 1996-2006.</p>
<p>Relative increase in vegetation shows as green and relative decrease as
pink.</p>
<p>Could the interviews with participants from that region provide any
clues as to why?</p>
<p>I can’t tell you that, but the point is that the more we enrich and link
data, the more possible hypotheses we can generate.</p>
<img alt=" The Graph " src="http://ptsefton.com/2015/06/11/2111/img11.jpg"/>  
<p>Here’s the graph of our solution: We created local records, so that the Dharmae hub could maintain its own set of ‘world-views’ while still interfacing with the semantic web knowledge graph.  This design pattern is something we want to explore more: having a local
record for an entity or concept, with links to external authorities. So,
for example we might use a Dbpedia URI for a person, and quote a
particular ‘approved’ version of the wikipedia page about them so there
is a local, stable proxy for an external URI, but the local record is
still part of the global graph. With the species data, this will allow
researchers to explore the way the participants in Talking Fish talked
about fish and compare this to what the Atlas of Living Australia says
about nomenclature and distribution.</p>

<p>From the [Journey to Horshoe Bend Website[(http://pubsites.uws.edu.au/coa/soca/jthb/index.html&quot;/&gt; at the University of Western Sydney:  &gt; TGH Strehlow’s biographical memoir, Journey to Horseshoe Bend, is a</p>
<blockquote>
<p>vivid ethno-historiographic account of the Aboriginal, settler and
Lutheran communities of Central Australia in the 1920’s. The ‘Journey
to Horseshoe Bend’ project elaborates on Strehlow’s book in the form
of an extensive digital hub – a database and website - that seeks to
‘visualise’ the key textual thematics of Arrernte* identity and sense
of “place”, combined with a re-mapping of European and Aboriginal
archival objects related to the book’s social and cultural histories.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus far the project has produced a valuable collection of unique
historical and contemporary materials developed to encourage knowledge
sharing and to initiate knowledge creation. By bringing together a wide
variety of media – including photographs, letters, journals, Government
files, audio recordings, moving images, newspaper, newsletters,
interviews, manuscripts, an electronic version of the text and
annotations – the researchers hope to ‘open out’ the histories of
Central Australia’s Aboriginal, settler and missionary communities.</p>
<p>JTHB research work entailed creating annotations relating to sections of
the book text. The existing book text, marked up with TEI, was converted
to HTML and the annotations were anchored within the HTML. Plan was to
create an Omeka plugin to display the text and co-display or footnote
the annotations relating to each part of the text.</p>
<p>Issues</p>
<ul>
<li>The existing annotations were incomplete and the research team
wished to continue adding annotations and material. This meant that
the HTML would need to be continuously edited (outside Omeka),
giving rise to issues around workflow, researcher skills, and
version control.</li>
<li>Cultural sensitivities were also a barrier to open publication (not
an Omeka issue but a MODC one)</li>
</ul>
<img alt=" " src="http://ptsefton.com/2015/06/11/2111/img13.jpg"/> 
<p>Katrina Trewin is a data librarian, working at the University of Western Sydney. While the Journey to Horseshoe Bend project could not be completed using Omeka, due to resource constraints. Another project was able to be completed. Using Omeka, Katrina was able to build web site around an oral-history data set without needing any development. This
work took place in parallel with the work on Dharmae at UTS so was not
able to make use of some of the innovations introduced in that project
such as enhancements to the Item Relations plugin to allow
rich-interlinking between resources.</p>
<p>Katrina’s notes:</p>
<p>Material had been in care of researcher for 20+ years.</p>
<ul>
<li>Audio interviews on cassette, photographs, transcripts (some
electronic)</li>
<li>Digitised all the material</li>
<li>Created csv files for upload of item metadata into Omeka</li>
<li>Once collections of items were created, then used exhibit plugin to
bring material relating to each interviewee together.</li>
</ul>
<p>Worked well because collection was complete - fine to edit metadata in
Omeka but items themselves need to be stable (unlike the JTHB text)</p>
<p>Omeka allows item-level description which is not possible via
institutional repository. This could have been done in Omeka interface
but was more efficient via csv upload. csv files, bundled item files,
readme and Omeka xml output made available from institutional repository
record for longer term availability as hosting arrangement is not in
place. Chambers, Deborah; Liston, Carol; Wieneke, Christine (2015):

<p>Katrina and team have <a href="http://research-data.uws.edu.au/redbox/default/detail/f2a31293037a80d464bde06efced5f62/">published all the data as a set of files</a> with a link to the [website&quot; src=&quot;{attach}http://omeka.uws.edu.au/farmstofreeways/&quot;/&gt; , in the institutional research data repository.

similar thing with the Dharmae data.</p>
<p><img alt=" " src="http://ptsefton.com/2015/06/11/2111/img17.jpg"/>   At UTS we are are constructing a growing ‘grid’ of research data services. This diagram is a sketch of how Omeka fits into this bigger picture, showing the geonode mapping service which supplies map display services and can harvest maps from Omeka as well. In this architecture, all items ultimately end up in an archival repository with a catalogue
description, as I showed earlier for the Farms to Freeways data.</p>

<p><img alt=" " src="http://ptsefton.com/2015/06/11/2111/img19.jpg"/>   ### <strong>Conclusion</strong>  Omeka is a very simple <em>seeming</em> repository solution which is easy to dismiss for projects that demand the ‘perfect’ repository, but looking beyond its limitations it has some strengths that make it attractive for
creating ‘micro repository services’ (Field &amp; McSweeney 2014). Our work
has made it easier to set up new research-data repositories that adhere
to linked-data principles and create rich semantic web interfaces to
data collections. This paves the way for a new generation of micro or
workgroup-level research data repositories which link-to and re-use a
wide range of data sources.</p>

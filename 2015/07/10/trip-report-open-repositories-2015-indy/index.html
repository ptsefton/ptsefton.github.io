<h1> 
Trip report: open repositories 2015, Indy 
</h1>
<h2>2015-07-10 </h2>

<p>[ UPDATE 2015-07-10 In my excitement at launching a new site I managed to let not-quite finished version of this post out on the web. This version has minor edits and has fixed a missing image ]</p>
<p>This is my trip report from a recent trip to the USA, mainly to attend
the Open Repositories conference in Indianapolis.</p>
<h1>Keynote</h1>
<p>Kaitlin Thainey from the Mozilla Science labs gave the keynote. I was
looking forward to catching up with her about open this and open that but
she had to deliver her presentation remotely.</p>
<p>Kaitlin gave an overview
<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/kaythaney/leveraging-the-power-of-the-web-open-repositories-2015">Leveraging the power of the web - Open Repositories 2015</a>
of what's happening in the Open Science / Open research from her point
of view as the director of the Mozilla Science lab. There's a lot! It was nice to see
Research Bazaar (resbaz), the Aussie-grown eResearch training movement
get a mention alongside the likes of Software Carpentry. Mozilla Open
Science are doing great work in this space and we're trying to figure
out how we can get bring ResBaz and related training stuff to UTS.</p>

Access to content, data code, materials. Emergence of &quot;web-native&quot; tools. Rewards for openness, interoperability, collaboration, sharing. Push for ROI, reuse, recomputability, transparency."></p>
<p>There was also a featured plenary talk from Anurag Acharya at Google
scholar,
<a href="http://www.or2015.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/or-2015-anurag-google-scholar.pdf">Indexing Repositories: Pitfalls and Best Practices</a>. I have
to say that while the content was useful, and boiled down to &quot;if you
want to be in Google Scholar, don't build a sucky website&quot;. I found it
vaguely unsettling, like having a prophet drop by and give us a how-to
guide for getting into heaven. I dunno what their business model is,
but it's been clear for years that it doesn't involve asking the
owners of the repositories what they want or responding to emerging
trends like research data repositories just because we think they're
important. Still, it was good addition to the program and I guess if
we want to get in Google Scholar we have to listen to Google Scholar.</p>
<p>(Listening to Acharya's talk I was reminded of back in the day when my
team at USQ ran the national repository support service. At one stage
one of the major vendors was having a few performance problems with
their repository product which was quite widely deployed in
Australia. Essentially clicking on the 'show all' button for the repo
at some sites constituted a denial of service attack, so the vendor
advised people to use the robots.txt file to keep indexers from
killing the site. Months later we were still fielding calls from repo
managers wondering why their stuff was not in Google, let alone
Scholar.)</p>
<h1>My favourite: The Portland Common Data Model</h1>
<p>This year the thing that struck me the hardest was the
hot-off-the-press <a href="https://github.com/duraspace/pcdm/wiki">Portland Common Data Model</a> (PCDM), which captures a common
design pattern for repositories, similar to the
<a href="http://ptsefton.com/2014/09/22/digital-object-pattern-dop-vs-chucking-files-in-a-database-approaches-to-repository-design.htm">Digital Object Pattern</a> I was going on about last year. This model
grew out of discussions in the Hydra repository community, and has
spread to the general Fedora commons community and beyond. The model
distills the experience of building hundreds of digital repositories
into a design pattern.</p>
<p><img src="coll-object-file.png" alt="The PCDM model. Note the recursively nested collections and objects. Difference between objects and collections is that collections can't have files. And files have only technical metadata, descriptive metadata needs to be attached to abn object"></p>
<p>The github site <a href="https://github.com/duraspace/pcdm/wiki">says</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Portland Common Data Model (PCDM) is a flexible, extensible
domain model that is intended to underlie a wide array of repository
and DAMS [They mean Digital Asset Management Systems, PS]
applications. The primary objective of this model is to establish a
framework that developers of tools (e.g., Hydra-based engines, such
as Sufia, Curate, Worthwhile, Avalon; Islandora; custom Fedora
sites) can use for working with models in a general way, allowing
adopters to easily use custom models with any tool. Given this
interoperability goal, the initial work has been focused on
structural metadata and access control, since these are the key
actionable metadata. To encourage adoption, this model must support
the most complex use cases, which include rich hierarchies of
inter-related collections and works, but also elegantly support the
simplest use cases, such as a single user-contributed file with a
few fields of metadata. It must provide a compact interface that
tool developers can easily implement, but also be extensible enough
for adopters to customize to their local needs. As the community
migrates to Fedora 4, much of our metadata is migrating to RDF. This
model encourages linked data best practices, such as using URIs to
identify all resources, using widely-used vocabularies where
possible, and subclassing existing classes and properties when
creating new terms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So why am I excited about the PCDM?</p>
<p>At UTS we use the Fedora Commons repository for the institutional
data repository, and we'll be upgrading from v3 to v4; the PCDM gives
us a good framework for organising data:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Like it says on the tin, it should improve repository interoperability, making it a bit
easier to port content from one PCDM-compliant repository environment
to another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It will make it easier to design re-usable APIs for generic
repository solutions around domain-agnostic abstractions. So in some
domains a hierarchy of two levels of 'collection' with an object
might consist of collections &quot;Facility / Experiment&quot; with Dataset as
an PCDM object type while in another the collection levels might be
&quot;Corpus / Sub corpus&quot; with a &quot;Communicative Event&quot; object, as in the
<a href="http://alveo.edu.au">Alveo</a> virtual lab for human communications
science, I presented about last year at OR 2014.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It will make it easier to map working repository and
presentation-repository systems onto archival repositories, as we
are planning at UTS. Eg, we want to 'shadow' all the content in
<a href="http://dharmae.research.uts.edu.au/">DHARMAE</a> collection-by-collection and item-by-item and file-by-file
in a preservation-ready data store. The PCDM gives us a formal way
to define that mapping.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It will provide a useful tool for specifying new systems, eg many
Data Capture applications, such as those funded by ANDS could benefit
from exposing their organisation in this way, making it clear how
content is organised using simple, generic shared concepts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two things that are less than perfect, IMHO.</p>
<h2>PCDM Problem 1</h2>
<p>The biggest issue is that in RDF ordering lists of things is a
pain. In PCDM there's no whacking a set of square
brackets around a bunch of things and calling it a list. So implementing something like a
set of PCDM objects representing pages of a book means dealing with a
linked list.</p>
<p>Manu Sporny had a good <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-wg/2012May/0098.html">rant</a> about this back in 2012.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In summary - RDF Lists are difficult to implement, even for people
that know quite a bit about RDF. They are fantastically difficult to
grasp for Web developers. They are really hard to author in many of
the RDF syntaxes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or this <a href="http://manu.sporny.org/2014/json-ld-origins-2/">other rant</a> which is worth a read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>RDF is a shitty data model. It doesn’t have native support for lists.
LISTS for fuck’s sake! The key data structure that’s used by almost
every programmer on this planet and RDF starts out by giving
developers a big fat middle finger in that area.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What do we get in PCDM instead of web-developer-friendly lists? We get the ORE
ordering extension. ORE's full name is the Open Archive Initiative
Object Reuse and Exchange (<a href="https://www.openarchives.org/ore/">OAI-ORE</a>) standard for describing aggregations of web resources.</p>
<p><img src="ore-ordering-extension.png" alt="PCDM ordering"></p>
<p>I'm not really worried about this too much, as I assume we can put
JSON-LD APIs on this stuff  and let all the linked-list-horror happen
behind the scenes. JSON-LD, of course, handles list-ordering natively
that's why Manu and team invented it.</p>
<h2>PCDM Problem 2</h2>
<p>The other problem isn't really a problem as such, just that the
ability to do object-hierarchies will tempt some developers and
business analysts into dangerous territory.</p>
<p>To a computer scientist a book might look like a book object with a
bunch of page objects. But wait! Why stop there. Why don't we make the
pages out of paragraph objects! Actually, I know, lets do it at the sentence
level and assemble those into paragraph objects and then pages, and we can
have a parallel hierarchy for the logical structure of the book in
chapters as well, using proxies just like in ORE! Maybe we really should
probably do it a the word level. Or an object-per-glyph model
with ORE serialisation per-word?</p>
<p>Kids, hierarchical object models are fine in moderation, but do try to stop
before you grow hairs on your palms.</p>
<h2>Tell me I'm wrong!</h2>
<p>Comments welcome, if PCDM fans want to straighten me out on any of the above.</p>
<h1>Our presentation, Omeka, Ozmeka etc.</h1>
<p>This year I was presenting work done at UTS and UWS on adapting the
super-simple Omeka repository to use with linked-data research data. I
<a href="http://ptsefton.com/2015/06/11/2111.htm">blogged</a> this already. Didn't get many questions but quite a few people
told me they enjoyed the talk.</p>
<p>Post OR I popped over to visit the Omeka team at George Mason
University which is
in Fairfax Virginia, just out of Washington DC. I got a look at the
new <a href="https://github.com/omeka/omeka-s">Omeka S</a> which has a new linked-data ready data and
shows a lot of promise, and talked about the possibiity of having some
of the work we did on extending <a href="http://omeka.org/">Omeka</a> in the <a href="http://github.com/ozmeka/ozmeka">Ozmeka</a> project accepted
into the core of the Omeka 2.x line.</p>
<p>Thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/patrick_mj">Patrick Murray-John</a>, who says
stuff like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Patrick Murray-John ‏@patrick_mj  Jul 2
My code is jiggery-pokery applesauce.....WITH PEAS IN IT!!!!!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and Omeka Lead dev <a href="https://twitter.com/zerocrates">John Flatness</a> for
being so generous with your time.</p>

<h1>The developer challenge</h1>
<p>For the past few years I've been helping to organise the developer
challenge event and sat on the OR committee but I stepped back this year,
and did neither. Claire Knowles and Adam Field (who were part of one
of the winning teams in the dev challenge last year with the Fill My
List software for linked-data-lookup) stepped forward and ran a new
tech-stream, the Developer Track, and a new ideas challenge.</p>
<p><a href="http://libraryblogs.is.ed.ac.uk/librarylabs/2015/06/19/open-repositories-2015/">Claire says</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Developer Track was new for OR15, it was designed, along with
the Ideas Challenge, to stop the developers who attend the conference
being torn between writing code for a competition and attending
conference sessions. There were lots of demos and it was great to see
no one having to apologise for screens of code, XML and terminal
windows. I found the sessions really practical and have a list of
things to try now I am back in the office, starting with Hardy
Pottinger’s Vagrant-DSpace.
...
The Ideas Challenge, was designed to be less time intensive that the
previously run Developer Challenge but still encourage people to
discuss issues they would like to resolve, meet new people, and have
a fun session where audience participation was encouraged. Adam and
I created an example challenge and solution based on the Sound of
Music [Idea’s Challenge Slides](Idea’s Challenge Slides). We had 9 entries to the challenge
this year and thanks to Adam’s scoresheet there were no long
deliberations and a clear winner was identified after our judges
handed in their scores. Congratulations to the winners

</blockquote>
<p>Loved the sound of music thing, Claire, it was one of my
favourites. And a I liked dropping in to the Dev Track and looking at
comforting screens full of code and edgy live demos.</p>

<h1>In other news</h1>
<p><a href="http://dspace.org">DSpace</a> is still going strong, incrementally pushing towards becoming
the perfect repository. I believe it has an API now so it can be used
sans user interface. It does have a few quirks, like the fact that
there are actually two species of user interface that are both being
maintained but it's a solid choice for simply-structured
repositories (and some not so simple ones too).</p>
<p>I caught up with Bram Luyten from DSpace service provider [Atmire],
which has grown from a tiny consultancy to having more than a dozen
employees over the last few years, a sign both of the strength and
solidity of DSpace, and of the repository movement in general.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.eprints.org">ePrints</a> is also still alive and kicking,
though the user group sessions are much smaller in North America than
they are in Europe, close to its home in Southampton. The ePrints
community is gearing up for a huge de-tangling session, unpicking the
hair-ball of Perl code at the centre of the thing to make it more
modular. I didn't stay long enough to ask if they're going to stick
with Perl as a language. Anyway, if I were setting up a publications
repository on a tight budget ePrints would still be on my list of
candidate systems, and there's the commercial services arm too, for
hosting and support.</p>
<p>#The venue, etc</p>
<p>The OR conference series alternates between North America and Europe
year to year, not counting the first episode which took place in
Australia. There's a pretty clear difference between how these things
are hosted on either side of the Atlantic. In Europe we've had venues
that are a mixture of convention centre and university, including some
scruffy lecture halls and the odd gem like developer rooms at the Finnish
National Library, whereas the North American model is to use a
hotel convention centre which, I believe, is so the accommodation
offsets the cost of the meeting rooms.</p>
<p>The conference was well organised, the food was plentiful and tasty
and the venue was fine if you like that sort of thing. I.e. a big climate controlled bubble.</p>
<p><img src="hotel.JPG" alt="The hotel had a big lightwell down the middle"></p>
<p>This one was in the hotel district in Indianapolis, Indiana where the
main industry seems to be convention centres. There is a river you can
walk along, and one of those bike-share schemes with large yellow bike
shaped things made of depleted uranium. I tried the service one wet
day, it even came with decorative attachments resembling brake levers
but which turned out to be a semaphore-like mechanism for politely
suggesting to the bike that it might be nice to consider slowing down,
if it was OK with the bike, and it had time, etc. Was a fun exercise
planning ahead to see if we could agree be stopped at the
intersections.</p>
<p><img src="peppy.JPG" alt="I liked this place"></p>
<p><img src="sheriff.JPG" alt="And this was comforting, knowing the Sheriff's office was in the top 1% in America!"></p>
<p>The conference dinner was at an art museum on the other side of town.</p>
<p><img src="art.JPG" alt="The dinner venue, which as in an art gallery. By the way, I know all about art but I don’t know what I like."></p>
<h1>And</h1>
<p><img src="arthurs.JPG" alt="I took one of the city's yellow hire bikes off to Arthur's music and bought a tiny banjo."></p>
<p>'<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gold-Tone-Plucky-String-Vintage/dp/B002RARBTY">Plucky</a>'comes set up in an open C tuning cGCEG (the little c is the
5th string, an octave above the 3rd) which is only one tone away from
being a standard uke tuning. So naturally, I wound the 1st string G up
to an A. Now it's an honorary ukulele and I have not been kicked out
of the <a href="http://www.bluemugs.com.au/">Blue Mountains Ukulele Group</a> for bringing it, yet. Plucky
gets marked down in reviews for having crappy tuners and being a bit hard to
set up with good intonation, but it's a solid piece of gear and lots
of fun and it's the only option for a mass market 5-string in that
super-short scale length. I'll have to dig out my copy of Pete's
<a href="http://www.folkways.si.edu/pete-seeger/how-to-play-the-5-string-banjo/music-instruction/music/album/smithsonian">How to play the 5-string Banjo</a>.</p>
<p><img src="kim.JPG" alt="Here's Kim Shepherd (also from the Fill My List team with Adam and Claire), playing the tiny banjo, Plucky, and a tiny game, in the hotel lobby, both at the same time!"></p>

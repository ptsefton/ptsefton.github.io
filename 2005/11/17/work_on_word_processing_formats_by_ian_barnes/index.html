<h1> 
Work on word processing formats by Ian Barnes 
</h1>
<h2>2005-11-17 </h2>

<div>
<p>On Wednesday I was a guest at the <strong>Australian Partnership for
Sustainable Repositories</strong> (<a href="http://www.apsr.edu.au/">APSR</a>) planning
day, which helped me get my head around the diverse projects coordinated
under the APSR banner. We're going to be talking a lot with APSR at the
<a href="http://www.rubric.edu.au/">RUBRIC</a> project where I work.</p>
<p>The highlight for me was a talk by <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/blog/barnes">Ian
Barnes</a> of
<a href="http://www.anu.edu.au/">ANU</a> on Sustainability in word processing
formats. He was looking at how you can take a word processing document
and turn it into an archive-quality XML document.</p>
<p>I liked his presentation partly because Ian is working with our
<a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/">ICE</a> templates, developed at USQ. This is
interesting because it means that our <strong>open source project is
working</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>we have <strong>more smart people</strong> testing and extending the styles, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the ANU work is trying <strong>new things</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Ian said that for a sustainable format you need something that is:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>XML</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Non proprietary, and open. (Ian said non-commercial)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Here was the list of contenders for an archival document format:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.docbook.org/">DocBook</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.tei-c.org/">TEI</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>XHTML</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Custom schemas</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Ian voted off these two:</p>
<p>Custom schemas
:   Because of the costs and obvious unsustainability involved</p>
<p>XHTML
:   Because it is essentially flat. While XHTML does allow nesting, if
you start using particular conventions for nesting elements then
that's a custom schema, Ian argued. I'll come back to this point.</p>
<p>Ian <strong>picked DocBook</strong> for his demonstration system, and as a likely
contender for long term document storage, because of the <strong>existing
toolchain</strong>.</p>
<p>Using OpenOffice.org Writer, he was able to demonstrate a <strong>complex
ICE-based test document</strong> that had all sorts of nested lists, block
quotes and pre-formatted text and images. Saved it into a directory and
was able to show via a Java-based web server (Cocoon) the original
OpenDocument Format document (the XML), a <strong>DocBook version</strong> and then
an <strong>XHTML version</strong>. It also does <strong>PDF</strong>.</p>
<p>I <strong>liked</strong> the new direction, and the idea of plugging into the
<strong>DocBook toolchain</strong> because of all the stuff you get for nothing, but
later discussions indicate there <strong>might be some problems</strong>,
particularly with documents that mix numbered and un-numbered headings,
and with jumps between heading levels (like putting heading 4
immediately after heading 1. What do you put in your archival format in
a case like that where the author wants the feel of small divisions with
a low-level heading, but the schema may insist that that is not allowed?</p>
<p>Which brings me to one of the <strong>constraints on this exercise</strong> â€“ if
you're going to be capturing with a word processor you need to live with
what it's capable of, and your software will always have to build any
nested structure out of a flat series of paragraphs and lists, so I'm
not convinced that using DocBook buys all that much more than using
existing tools, which could, in time be written for a constrained
version of XHTML. But I am intrigued, and also am all for using existing
software where possible so I'd like to <strong>see how far</strong> Ian and the ANU
team can take this.</p>
<p>I got the chance to go into more detail with Ian after lunch (thanks
APSR). He's got <strong>a nice set of chained XSLT stylesheets</strong> that turn the
ICE styles in a word processing document into DocBook by doing one bit
at a time. This is a more manageable approach that the one I took with
the original ICE XSLT; at that stage I thought we'd need to have a
single XSLT because I had this (very wrong) idea that the export system
in OpenOffice.org was worth using.</p>
<p>But even with Ian's much simpler chain of stylesheets it's at the limits
of the useful range for XSLT, it might be better to <strong>switch to a
procedural version</strong> using a 'normal' language like Java or Python.
There's someone else working on this that I know of, but no release yet.</p>

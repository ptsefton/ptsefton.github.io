<p>I've been going on here about using styles, but some concrete examples
are probably worthwhile as Bryan D. Wilhite has <a href="http://www.kintespace.com/rasxlog/?p=198">asked on his
blog</a> about what I mean by
this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>why not use the built-in word processing features and layer your
semantics on top of them? Use the methods already provided for
expressing your own semantics. Method number one is styles. Method
number two is tables. This approach will work in versions of Word that
don't have XML export, and with forthcoming Word formats that have
been announced but not released and with other word processors that
save in XML such as OpenOffice.org Writer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://ptsefton.com/blog/2005/08/13/more_on_microsoft_word_vs_xml_schemas">http://ptsefton.com/blog/2005/08/13/more_on_microsoft_word_vs_xml_schemas</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr Wilhite shows how he uses his clean XTHML tool to write his blog in
Word 2003, and wonders whether I use tables where he uses XML elements
mixed in with Word's markup. The answer is no. I don't use tables. I
<a href="http://ptsefton.com/blog/2005/03/02/use_styles">use styles</a>.</p>
<p>First of all, there's one area we have in common. A paragraph is a
paragraph.</p>
<p>In his screenshot it appears that Bryan has used Word's built in
structure to represent paragraphs. It looks like links are handled in a
similar way â€“ using Word's built-in hyperlinking function. Again, when I
am producing a blog entry that's what I do too (only I am using
OpenOffice.org Writer, not Word).</p>
<p>Where we differ is in the use of inline elements like <code>acronym</code>.</p>
<p>(In the spirit of Bryan Whilite's self-referential post I have added the
style names I used to write this post to the rest of the paragraphs).
<code>{p}</code></p>
<p>So, to answer Bryan Wilhite's questions of me: <code>{p}</code></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For the example you have given I would not resort to tables, but
would use the in-build word processor structures for paragraphs,
links and images. In your example I'd use a style like 'p' for every
paragraph and then have the back-end code turn that into an XTHML ``</p>
<p>. <code>{li1b}</code></p>
<p>For the inline elements, such as acronym I'd use a character style.
In the ICE system, we use character styles based on XHTML element
names so you would mark XML with the character-style <code>i-acronym</code>.
(For a list of the styles we use see <a href="http://trac.officecontent.net/wiki/WpInteropStyles">my word processing
site</a>). <code>{li1p}</code></p>
<p>Where I would use tables would be in a case like a sidebar or in the
educational context, a reading or an activity. Say I want to put in
an activity, I would use a table with two cells in one column. The
top cell would contain a paragraph in style <code>h-activity</code>, and the
bottom cell would contain the activity itself, a mixture of text and
graphics. The back-end processing system would recognize that it's
dealing with an activity and could treat it specially, probably by
throwing away the table code and putting the activity into a iv
<code>class='activity'&gt;</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don't think much about the Word XML task pane, I have never used
Word's XML features in the way that you're using them, because as
<a href="http://ptsefton.com/blog/2005/08/13/more_on_microsoft_word_vs_xml_schemas">noted before
here</a>
I think they are a bad idea for writing documents. <code>{li1b}</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's a bit tricky to answer Bryan's final question about what's
wrong with the system he's built. I think it is solving a problem
that I don't have. I wouldn't like to try to roll it out to authors
here are the university because: <code>{li1b}</code></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It uses Word 2003, which means it locks out Mac and Linux users
and probably working from home for many people. <code>{li2n}</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It uses WordProcessingML which is about to become obsolete and
code that runs in Word that I would not like to try to run in a
server environment. <code>{li2n}</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It requires users to deal with new interface elements like the
XML task pane. <code>{li2n}</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have <a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/">our own way of making XHTML</a>
which uses styles to do most of the heavy lifting, and can
create course-packages for upload to a Learning Management
System. <code>{li2n}</code></p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So Bryan Wilhite, I have a question for you. Would you be interested in
exploring with me whether we can get your clean XHTML system to use
styles to produce its output? <code>{p}</code></p>

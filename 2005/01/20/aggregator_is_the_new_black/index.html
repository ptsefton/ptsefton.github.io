<h1> 
Aggregation will be rough on Learning Management Systems 
</h1>
<h2>2005-01-20 </h2>

<p><a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/usqsdt">We've</a> been kicking around ideas about
the future of Learning Management Systems (LMSs) at work, in various
informal and semi-formal groups.</p>
<p>I think that one of the pressures on current LMSs will be from the
aggregator. An aggregator is a leveling technology that can pull all the
stuff in which you are interested into a common interface; sort of a do
it yourself 'portal' without the stupid little boxes and the feeble
'customize' button.</p>
<p>One of the things aggregators will level is the wall around the 'walled
garden' in LMSs; WebCT and Blackboard and the like.</p>
<p>Peter Albion, one of the folk we've been talking to, has
<a href="http://edux.usq.edu.au/~albion/weblog/">blogged</a> a couple of links on
this in the last few days:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cetis.ac.uk/members/scott/blogview?entry=20050117150356">This
one</a>
from Scott Wilson talks about the LMS becoming an aggregator. I think
this is on the right track, but I think the point about aggregators is
that they sit outside of any one domain, so I think it's more likely
that the LMS will become an aggregatable component. Anyway the Virtual
Learning Environments he's talking about include the browser as a
component, so maybe we do agree.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think the VLE of the future is going to be less like an information
portal, and more like an aggregator. its going to be more like an
editing and publishing tool and less like a browser. Its going to
break out of the browser window and sit on the desktop. The VLE of the
future will look less like a Content Management System or Intranet,
and more like a cross between Shrook, SubEthaEdit,XJournal, Chat,
iCal, and iTunes (well, on a Mac at least). It will be slick and
minimal, and will actually be fun to use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So when (OK, it is still an if) aggregators are used by <em>everybody</em> to
pull together all the changing stuff they want to track: the news, the
goss, the weather, the state of their orders from online vendors, their
library loans, their friends' holiday snaps, data from the life-support
machine that the much-loved mongrel dog is hooked up to at the vet's at
$800/day, pix from the PI of spousal misbehaviour, the state of their
phone bill once a day, specials at the local bistro, chapters of books
they're pretending to read, Nicole Kidman's weight, new additions to the
bill at the <a href="http://bluesfest.com.au/">East Coast Blues and Roots
Festival</a> (warning, too much Flash, but see
you there ok?), tide times, tasks, cricket scores, the kid's reports,
uni marks, positions vacant, email, when all that is in your aggregator
do you want a 'portal' in your LMS? Do you want an LMS in your life? I
don't think so. Most people will live their online life in the
aggregator + browser + 'synchronous chat/alert system' combo and things
that don't have feeds to aggregate will <em>not</em> be invited. You won't go
to the uni via an LMS. It will come to you, piecemeal.</p>
<p>I think that smart universities will offer not only email for life (like
<a href="http://www.cedarville.edu/alumni/emailforlife.htm">this one</a> for people
of high moral character, where &quot;Messages sent from the account should be
honoring to the Lord in content and tone&quot;), but a
<a href="http://bloglines.com/">Bloglines-like</a> aggregator, integrated with
mail, chat, calendar, addresses, and with bookmarking system like
<a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> and some other stuff. Amongst the
'other stuff' will be the bits and pieces that make up an LMS:</p>
<ul>
<li>Content authoring and consuming, including discussion items</li>
<li>Quizzing and assessment, integrated with the content.</li>
<li>Your portfolio of work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Universities have a great opportunity here to create a home-place online
that could be incredibly sticky. If Yahoo can afford to give me
ultra-reliable email with 100MB storage for free for years in the vain
hope that I'll click the ads surely a uni can do it, safe in the
knowledge that they can market lifelong learning services, as discussed
<a href="http://www.westga.edu/~distance/ojdla/winter74/chambers74.htm">here</a>
(Via Peter Albion) in the Melbourne Uni context by Dianne P. Chambers,
to you for as long as they keep their offering compelling.</p>
<p>I know that alumni sites are already here, but are any of them
aggregating? Have they heard that aggregator is the new black?</p>

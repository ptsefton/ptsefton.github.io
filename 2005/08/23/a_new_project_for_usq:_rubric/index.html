A new project for USQ: RUBRIC 
</h1>
<h2>2005-08-23 </h2>

<p>Yesterday, the Australian Government decided to <a href="http://www.dest.gov.au/Ministers/Media/Nelson/2005/08/n1173220805.asp">share out some
money</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Australia’s research information infrastructure will be enhanced with
today’s announcement that the Australian Government will invest a
further $19.4 million to fund nine projects under the Systemic
Infrastructure Initiative (SII).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the the nine projects, described in <a href="http://www.dest.gov.au/sectors/research_sector/policies_issues_reviews/key_issues/australian_research_information_infrastructure_committee/documents/outcomes_call_for_proposals_doc.htm">this Word
document</a>
(pretending to be a web page!) will be led by USQ:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Regional Universities Building Research Infrastructure Collaboratively
(RUBRIC) Lead Institution University of Southern Queensland
$3,872,700</p>
<p>RUBRIC will develop infrastructure and capability across regional and
smaller universities to maximise access to digital research resources.
This project wishes to take on the best practice developed from the
existing FRODO projects and develop similar institutional repositories
in thirteen other universities. RUBRIC will provide a means for these
institutions to work in a structured framework using the latest tools,
to act collectively and to develop the expertise that will be
necessary to respond to emerging needs of the Research Quality and
Accessibility Frameworks across universities.</p>
<p>Partners: University of New England, University of the Sunshine Coast,
University of Newcastle (for the Intensive Research Universities of
Australia), Massey University</p>
</blockquote>
<p>FRODO?</p>
<p>That's described
<a href="http://www.dest.gov.au/sectors/higher_education/programmes_funding/programme_categories/research_related_opportunities/systemic_infrastructure_initiative/callforproposals.htm">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First Stage - Current Projects</p>
<p>Four major demonstrator projects are directly related to addressing
these goals, namely:</p>
<p><strong>Meta Access Management System Project (MAMS) - MAMS will provide an
essential &quot;middleware&quot; component to increase the efficiency and
effectiveness of Australia’s higher education research information
infrastructure. It will develop a new conceptual architecture which is
capable of supporting multiple, independent models, and which is
implemented locally within organisations, with the potential for
inter-institutional communication.
<a href="http://www.melcoe.mq.edu.au/projects/MAMS/">http://www.melcoe.mq.edu.au/projects/MAMS/</a></strong></p>
<p>The Australian Research Repositories Online to the World (ARROW) -
ARROW will identify and test a software solution or solutions to
support best-practice institutional digital repositories comprising
e-prints, digital theses and electronic publishing. It will develop a
repository and associated metadata to support independent scholars
(those not associated with institutions). <a href="http://arrow.edu.au/">http://arrow.edu.au/</a></p>
<p><strong>Towards an Australian Partnership for Sustainable Repositories
(APSR) - APSR will have an overall focus on the critical issues of the
access, continuity and sustainability of digital collections. It will
also build on a base of demonstrators for digital continuity and
sustainability, embedded in developmental repository facilities within
partner institutions. <a href="http://apsr.edu.au/">http://apsr.edu.au/</a> and</strong></p>
<p>Australian Digital Theses Program Expansion and Redevelopment (ADT) -
ADT will redevelop the existing central metadata repository of the
Australian Digital Theses Program (ADT) to increase its coverage and
utility to the national and international research community. The
repository’s content will expand to include metadata about all
Australian higher degree theses.
<a href="http://adt.caul.edu.au/adtariic.html">http://adt.caul.edu.au/adtariic.html</a></p>
<p>Collectively these are called the Federated Repositories of Digital
Objects (FRODO) projects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I contributed a few words to the RUBRIC proposal that helped land this
funding, others did much, much more work. I'll introduce them later...</p>

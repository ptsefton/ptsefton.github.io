<h1> 
PowerPoint: Good Points 
</h1>
<h2>2005-04-17 </h2>

<p>It's very fashionable to say nasty things about Microsoft PowerPoint,
but there are aspects of it that I really like.</p>
<p>Powerpoint is a structured editor. True a page (slide) is one of the
structural elements, which is a pretty major constraint, necessary in a
presentation program, but it also has a very clear distinction the
difference between presentation, via templates, and content.</p>
<p>Within the content, each slide has a title, and a hierarchy of bullet
points and notes (unless, of course you ignore that and put all the
content in pictures, which is done all too often).</p>
<p>There's an outline view, where you can edit the presentation and other
views that allow you to manipulate a document in different ways.</p>
<p>So, in some ways it's a fine example of the kinds of principles we go on
about in the XML world. I have never tried Apple's
<a href="http://www.apple.com/iwork/keynote/">Keynote</a>, I suppose I should since
I am using a Mac now, but
<a href="http://www.openoffice.org/OpenOffice.org">OpenOffice.org</a> has a similar
thing, which is not quite as usable but has the advantage of built in
PDF and Flash export.</p>
<p>I did a little googling on this idea and turned up
<a href="http://lists.xml.org/archives/xml-dev/200312/msg00286.html">this</a> from
Norm Walsh, part of a long thread that to the XML Dev mailing list.</p>
<p>Norm said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A structured editing tool is <strong>great</strong> for XML, but most of the
structured editors I've seen think they're doing you some sort of
favor by hiding the markup. To me, that's like hiding the punctuation.
Sure, lines of text and spaces unbroken by all those pesky periods and
commas would be simpler by some metric of simplicity, but they
wouldn't be easier (for me) to understand.</p>
<p>Most users coming to structured editing for the first time find all
the markup, if not frightening, then at least distracting. So
recommending that they use a structured editing tool that hides
complexity makes sense. I don't really see it as a goose/gander issue
as long as the tool you're recommending has the power to grow with
them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which seems fair enough, and PowerPoint certainly fits, it's a
structured editing tool that hides complexity. Except for the part about
growing. Bloating, maybe.</p>
<p>But then Norm has never touched PowerPoint, which is just as well 'cos I
think you'd want a two-buton mouse at least to use it, rather than just
a long pole.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To keep this on topic, I'll point out that I've never touched
PowerPoint or Impress or any of those other tools with a ten foot
pole, but I still, in retrospect, create bad slideware. Lots of
bullets. I'll have to think about that.</p>

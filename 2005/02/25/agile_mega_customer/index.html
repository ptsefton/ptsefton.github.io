<h1> 
The Agile MegaCustomer 
</h1>
<h2>2005-02-25 </h2>

<p>The agile software development proceeds at my place of work with little
baby steps.</p>
<p>One thing I've heard and read about eXtreme Programming is that you want
to have one and only one customer to deal with, not a committee, and
particularly not the kind of committee you get in a place like a
university.</p>
<p>So this week we're building us a great big aggregated mega customer.
Everybody
<a href="http://www.lyricsondemand.com/soundtracks/r/therockyhorrorpictureshowlyrics/sweettransvestitelyrics.html">sing</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So come up to the lab. And see what's on the slab.</p>
<p>I see you shiver with antici... pation!</p>
<p>I've been making a man with blond hair and a tan</p>
<p>And he's good for relieving my tension</p>
<p>(Remixed by me)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The customer needs to be able to make responsible decisions about which
features get built in what order, which means they need to be closely
aligned with the project and understand the software as it is
developing. This immediately rules out executive types who drop in to
the meeting and choose features that sound cool or cheap or whatever.</p>
<p>Problem is that we are working in a university environment. Without
going into specifics I believe I could say that we have competing
requirements from the production-focused team who get books and web
sites out the door, and the authors who all want a different blend of
flexibility and corporate standardization, and the Instructional Design
team.</p>
<p>We can't pick just one customer from all these stakeholders. So we have
decided to try to make do with two. One is from the production side,
where deadlines mean something. As for the rest, the plan is each
engineering cycle to lock a bunch of people in a room with a copy of the
software we're building. The one left alive can come to our project
meeting and choose features for the next release.</p>
<p>Put less flippantly, we are going to start a group consisting of our
pilot authors together with other stakeholders with an interest in
pedagogy and course construction, with a facilitator from the team to
train them in the software and processes we are developing, and let them
work out how to send us one person to the project meetings. This is an
experiment.</p>
<p>The idea is that the group will start with raw prototype software, move
rapidly into piloting and end up as an ongoing user group.</p>
<p>I'll let youse know how we go.</p>

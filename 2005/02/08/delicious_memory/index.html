<h1> 
Del.icio.us as outboard memory 
</h1>
<h2>2005-02-08 </h2>

<p>I have started using
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> as part of my
'pt management system' (for managing me, something many so-called
managers have had an interesting time with in the past), in addition to
its role in forming an online log and
<a href="blog/2005/01/07/delicious_team">resource</a> for our team at work.</p>
<p>I am trying to remain on track with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">Getting Things Done
(GTD)</a>, and I'm now
onto my third pocket-sized notebook. This is much better than I've ever
done before, School diaries and work log-books only ever lasted a week
in the past.</p>
<p>So, with the stuff that I write down in the notebook I now make sure
that everything is reviewed once a week and anything that requires
further action is put into a system, often Outlook/Exchange; the
calendar, the task list (yes it's sub-optimal, but it's there and it
works through the web). Other things I turn into new documents in this
site, or new articles in the home Subversion repository - stubs that
remind me to get typing.</p>
<p>Today I was processing stuff from last week's CAUDIT conference in
Sydney, and I had a couple of quotes from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gosling">James
Gosling</a> to process. I
didn't want to forget them, but they were not tasks, or things I wanted
to write about (at least I didn't think I did). I'm not one of those
four post a day kind of bloggers.</p>
<p>I had this idea: look up the quotes on the net, working under the
assumption that most Goslingisms are probably fairly well documented and
bookmark them using del.icio.us. It worked for <a href="http://del.icio.us/ptsefton/learnonceworkanywhere">&quot;Learn once. Work
anywhere&quot;</a>, a cute
play on the Java slogan &quot;Write once, run anywhere&quot; which is kinder than
the usual parody.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Portability is a technically difficult goal to achieve, and Java's
success at that goal is a matter of some controversy. Although it is
indeed possible to write programs for the Java platform that behave
consistently across many host platforms, the large number of available
platforms with small errors or inconsistencies led some to parody
Sun's &quot;Write once, run anywhere&quot; slogan as &quot;Write once, debug
everywhere&quot;. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_programming_language">Wikipedia: The Java programming
language</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, I am using the bookmark manager to bookmark offline happenings by
finding online analogues. Sounds wrong. Feels OK.</p>
<p>But for something that I transcribed, probably a bit inaccurately as
&quot;Speaking as the guy who jiggled the butterfly's wings&quot; there appears to
be nothing available. What to do? It doesn't belong at the wikipedia, at
least not until the article there has a lot of other very basic stuff,
so I guess I have to blog it so I can put it in del.icio.us.</p>
<p>Which reminds me: must do that backup of my del.icio.us accounts, and
consider what I'm going to do if the service stops or things turn nasty
(In the calendar for tomorrow).</p>

        <h1> 
        Welcome Justine 
        </h1>
        <h2>2005-05-26 </h2>

        <p>Justine Larbalestier, who is an <em>actual published author</em> I know has a
<a href="http://www.justinelarbalestier.com/blog/">blog</a> - Justine got a mention
here
<a href="http://ptsefton.com/blog/2004/08/02/the_best_thing_about_blogs">before</a>.
For some reason she has added a link to this site in her 'roll of
blogs' - probably as a cruel joke at the expense of her readers, who
will be assaulted with technobabble and pink and yellow when they are
used to clever, cultured musings.</p>
<p>So just to cushion to the shock to those arriving here I'll say
something literary. And I'll put a literature link in the menu under
themes to point to this. And if I ever decide to read a book, then I'll
seriously consider reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1595140220/qid=1117103031/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/002-7971900-5191239?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">Magic or
Madness</a>
by Justine Larbalestier.</p>
<p>Justine's blog has no capital letters in it, which reminded me of <em>my</em>
book - which I typed out in the early nineties some time, got three
friends to read, entered in a literary prize and then shelved when I
didn't win. I wrote it because I was pissed off at a book that had won
the prize a year or two before.</p>
<p>In my book I had invented a particularly loathsome character called &quot;the
hippie&quot; who didn't use capital letters, except when I forgot that she
wasn't meant to. She was more like a bit of furniture than a character,
really. Not like Justine, but if she keeps up this all lower case stuff,
who knows?</p>
<p>This bit is at a drunken party/meeting in a bedroom:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Hey, youse. I've got an idea.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;?&quot; said eight eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Lets all pick a book that we think is relevant to the film. Then
we'll all read each other's books. That way we'll start to get an idea
of where it should go.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not reading the book the hippie picks. Or Rose. Or yours Bruce,&quot;
said Mary.</p>
<p>This didn't deter the hippie, who said, &quot;i pick all of the great
religious books of the world. the i-ching, the christian bible, the
quorum, the zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance, the baghavad
gita, the karma sutra, and â€¦ i forget the others. great stuff.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;See?&quot; said Mary. &quot;I told you all so.&quot; She swept an arm expansively
and inaccurately around the bed to make her point. &quot;The hippie picked
about four hundred books she hasn't read.&quot; She crawled across the
mattress onto the floor and leant in close to the hippie. &quot;Have you
read these books hippie?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;i don't need to, mary. i am in touch with the spiritual planes
already. all is clear to me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I've read that lot anyway, or bits thereof,&quot; Mary told her, lying.
&quot;And maybe quorum does not mean what you think it means.&quot;</p>

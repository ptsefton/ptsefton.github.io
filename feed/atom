&lt;p&gt;Here is the abstract as submitted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Language Data Commons of Australia Data Partnerships (LDaCA) and the Australian Text Analytics Platform (ATAP) are building towards a scalable and flexible language data and analytics commons. These projects will be  part of the Humanities and Social Sciences Research Data Commons (HASS RDC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Data Commons will focus on preservation and discovery of distributed multi-modal language data collections under a variety of governance frameworks. This will include access control that reflects ethical constraints and intellectual property rights, including those of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander,  migrant and Pacific communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The platform will provide workbench services to support computational research, starting with code-notebooks with no-code research tools provided in later phases. Research artefacts such as code and derived data will be made available as fully documented research objects that are re-runnable and rigorously described. Metrics to demonstrate the impact of the platform are projected to include usage statistics, data and article citations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation we will present the proposed architecture of the system, the principles that informed it and demonstrate the first version. Features of the solution include the use of the Arkisto Platform (presented at eResearch 2020), which leverages the Oxford Common File Layout. This enables storing complete version-controlled digital objects described using linked data with rich context via the Research Object Crate (RO-Crate) format. The solution features a distributed authorization model where the agency archiving data may be separate from that authorising access.&lt;/p&gt;

Be sustainable, with a focus on data preservation as an overriding concern - data will not be ‚Äòtrapped‚Äô in a particular platform and all data and code developed on the platform will be in a ‚Äúmigration free‚Äù layout ready for reuse

make data from ATAP and LDaCA and collections discoverable - with the caveat that harvesting harmonised metadata from existing corpora may be difficult
Provide workbench services for computational research - starting with code-notebooks but with the aim of building towards no-code environments and automatically re-runnable workflows
include clear licensing on all data and code on how data may be reused, informed by a legally sound policy framework, with an access-control framework to allow automated data access where possible (there are some external dependencies here)
be distributed - with data held by a number of different organizations under a variety of governance models and technologies  (potentially including copies for redundancy or to put data close to compute  and analytical services)
enable best-practice in research, with research products such as code and derived data available as ‚Äúfully documented research objects‚Äù that as as re-runnable and rigorously described as possible

' title='5' border='1'  width='85%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diagram which we developed with Marco La Rosa makes a distinction between managed repository storage and the places where work is done - ‚Äúworkspaces‚Äù. Workspaces are where researchers collect, analyse and describe data. Examples  include the most basic of research IT services, file storage as well as analytical tools such as Jupyter notebooks (the backbone of ATAP - the text analytics platform). Other examples of workspaces include code repositories such as GitHub or GitLab (a slightly different sense of the word repository), survey tools, electronic (lab) notebooks and bespoke code written for particular research programmes - these workspaces are essential research systems but usually are not set up for long term management of data.
The cycle in the centre of  this diagram shows an idealised research practice where data are collected and described and deposited into a repository frequently. Data are made findable and accessible  as soon as possible and can be ‚Äúre-collected‚Äù for use and re-use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For data to be re-usable by humans and machines (such as ATAP notebook code that consumes datasets in a predictable way) it must be well described. The ATAP and LDaCA approach to this is to use the Research Object Crate (RO-Crate) specification. RO-Crate is essentially a guide to using a number of standards and standard approaches to describe both data and re-runnable software such as workflows or notebooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;' title='6' border='1'  width='85%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of the previous high-level map distinguishing workspaces and repository services, we are using the Arkisto Platform (introduced &lt;a href="http://ptsefton.com/2020/11/23/Arkisto/index.html"&gt;at eResearch 2020&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arkisto is an approach to eResearch service that places the emphasis on ensuring the long term preservation of data independently of code and services - recognizing the ephemeral nature of software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of a corpus is the PARADISEC collection - Pacific and Regional Archive for Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PARADISEC has viewers for various content types: video and audio with time aligned transcriptions, image set viewers and document viewers (xml, pdf and microsoft formats). We are working on making these viewers available across Arkisto sites by having a standard set of hooks for adding viewer plugins to a site as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This slide captures the overall high-level architecture - there will be an analytical workbench (left of the diagram) which is the basis of the Australian Text Analytics (ATAP) project - this will focus on notebook-style programming using one of the emerging Jupyter notebook platforms in that space. The exact platform is not 100% decided yet, but that has not stopped the team from starting to collect and develop notebooks that open up text analytics to new coders from the linguistics community. Our engagement lead, Dr Simon Musgrave sees the ATAP work as primarily an educational enterprise - which will be underpinned by services built on the Arkisto standards that allow for rigorous, re-runnable research.&lt;/p&gt;

Our demo today looks at this part ‚Ä¶
' title='9' border='1'  width='85%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we will look in detail at one important part of this architecture - access control. How can we make sure that in a distributed system, with multiple data repositories and registries residing with different data custodians, the right people have access to the right data?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn‚Äôt spell this out in the recorded conference presentation, but for data that resides in the repositories at the right of the diagram we want to encourage research processes that clearly separate data from code. Notebooks and other code workflows that use data will fetch a version-controlled reference copy from a repository - using an access key if needed, process the data and produce results that are then deposited into an appropriate repository alongside the code itself.  Given that a lot of the data in the language world is NOT available under open licenses such as Creative Commons it is important to establish this practice - each user of the data must negotiate or be granted access individually. Research can still be reproducible using this model, but without a culture of sharing datasets without regard for the rights of those who were involved in the creations of the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'&gt;
&lt;img src='http://ptsefton.com/2021/10/12/ldaca2021/Slide10.png' alt='
&lt;p&gt;' title='10' border='1'  width='85%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding rights, our project is informed by the &lt;a href="https://www.gida-global.org/care"&gt;CARE principles&lt;/a&gt; for indegenous data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current movement toward open data and open science does not fully engage with Indigenous Peoples rights and interests. Existing principles within the open data movement (e.g. FAIR: findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) primarily focus on characteristics of data that will facilitate increased data sharing among entities while ignoring power differentials and historical contexts. The emphasis on greater data sharing alone creates a tension for Indigenous Peoples who are also asserting greater control over the application and use of Indigenous data and Indigenous Knowledge for collective benefit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'&gt;

&lt;p&gt;' title='11' border='1'  width='85%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://localcontexts.org/labels/traditional-knowledge-labels/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are designing the system so that it can work with diverse ways of expressing access rights, for example licensing like the Tribal Knowledge labels.The idea is to separate safe storage of data with a license on each item, which may reference the TK labels from a system that is administered by the data custodians who can make decisions about who is allowed to access data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;img src='http://ptsefton.com/2021/10/12/ldaca2021/Slide12.png' alt='Case Study - Sydney Speaks
&lt;p&gt;' title='12' border='1'  width='85%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are working on a case-study with the &lt;a href="http://www.dynamicsoflanguage.edu.au/sydney-speaks/"&gt;Sydney Speaks project&lt;/a&gt; via steering committee member Professor Catherine Travis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project seeks to document and explore Australian English, as spoken in Australia‚Äôs largest and most ethnically and linguistically diverse city ‚Äì Sydney.
The title ‚ÄúSydney Speaks‚Äù captures a key defining feature of the project: the data come from recorded conversations between Sydney siders, as they tell stories about their lives and experiences, their opinions and attitudes. This allows us to measure how their lived experiences impact their speech patterns.
Working within the framework of variationist sociolinguistics, we examine variation in phonetics, grammar and discourse, in an effort to answer questions of fundamental interest both to Australian English, and language variation and change more broadly, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How has Australian English as spoken in Sydney changed over the past 100 years?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has the change in the ethnic diversity over that time period (and in particular, over the past 40 years) had any impact on the way Australian English is spoken?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What affects the way variation and change spread through society
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who are the initiators and who are the leaders in change?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do social networks function in a modern metropolis?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What social factors are relevant to Sydney speech today, and over time (gender? class? region? ethnic identity?)
A better understanding of what kind of variation exists in Australian English, and of how and why Australian English has changed over time can help society be more accepting of speech variation and even help address prejudices based on ways of speaking.

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collection contains recordings of people speaking both contemporary and historic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because this involved human participants there are restrictions on the distribution of data - a situation we see with lots of studies involving people in a huge range of disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'&gt;
&lt;img src='http://ptsefton.com/2021/10/12/ldaca2021/Slide13.png' alt='Sydney Speaks Licenses
' title='13' border='1'  width='85%'/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are four tiers of data access we need to enforce and observe for this data based on the participant agreements and ethics arrangements under which the data were collected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concerns about rights and interests are important for any data involving people - and a large amount the data both indigenous and non-indigenous we are using will require access control that ensures that data sharing is appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'&gt;
&lt;img src='http://ptsefton.com/2021/10/12/ldaca2021/Slide14.gif' alt='Demo
' title='14' border='1'  width='85%'/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example demo we uploaded various collections and are authorising with Github organisations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a our production release we will use AAF to authorise different groups&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's find a dataset: The Sydney Speaks Corpus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see we cannot see any data&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets login‚Ä¶ We authorise Github‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you can see we have access sub corpus data and I am just opening a couple of items&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äî&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in Github we can see the group management example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have given access to all the licences to myself, as you can see here and given access to licence A to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'&gt;

&lt;p&gt;' title='15' border='1'  width='85%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This diagram is a sketch of the interaction that took place in the demo - it shows how a repository can delegate authorization to an external system - in this case Github rather than CILogon. But we are working with the ARDC to set up a trial with the Australian Access Federation to allow CILogon access for the HASS Research Data Commons so we can pilot group-based access control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: This diagram has been updated slightly from the version presented at the conference to make it clear that the lookup to find the licence for the data set is &lt;em&gt;internal&lt;/em&gt; to the repository - the id is a DOI but it is not being resolved over the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shown an overview of a complete Data Commons Architecture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Previewed a distributed access-control mechanism which will separates out the the job of storing and delivering data from that of authorising access&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We'll be back next year with more about how analytics and data repositories connect using structure and linked data.&lt;/li&gt;

If we want to make it accessible (as per the &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data"&gt;FAIR data&lt;/a&gt; principles) then at present each data repository/service has to handle its own access controls. In this post I argue that if we had a &lt;em&gt;Group Service&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Licence Service&lt;/em&gt; that allowed research teams to build their own groups and/or licences then the service could issue a Group Access Licence URLs. Other services such as repositories in a trusted relationship with the &lt;em&gt;Group/Licence Service&lt;/em&gt; holding content with digital licences which had such URLs could do a redirect dance (like with oAuth and other authentication protocols), sending the users who request access to digital objects to the &lt;em&gt;Group/Licence Service&lt;/em&gt; which could authenticate them and check if they have access rights then let the repository know whether or not to give them access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post I will look at some missing infrastructure for doing &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data"&gt;FAIR data&lt;/a&gt; (Reminder: FAIR is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable data) - and will cite the FAIR principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a dataset can be released under an open licence then that's no problem but if data is only available for reuse under some special circumstances to certain users for certain purposes then the research sector lacks general-purpose infrastructure to support this. Tech infrastrucure aside, we do have a way of handling this legally. You specify these special conditions using a &lt;em&gt;licence&lt;/em&gt; as per the FAIR principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R1.1. (Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage licence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The licence might say (in your local natural language) &amp;quot;Members of international research project XYX can access this dataset&amp;quot;. Or &amp;quot;contact us for a specific licence (and we'll add you to a license-holder group if approved)&amp;quot;. [Update: 2021-06-16 Or This content is licensed to an individual ID]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the dataset can be deposited in a repository, which will take care of &lt;em&gt;some of&lt;/em&gt; the FAIR principles for you including the F-word stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Findable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step in (re)using data is to find them. Metadata and data should be easy to find for both humans and computers. Machine-readable metadata are essential for automatic discovery of datasets and services, so this is an essential component of the FAIRification process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F1. (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F2. Data are described with rich metadata (defined by R1 below)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F3. Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F4. (Meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, you could somehow deal with all that with some bespoke software service, but the simplest solution is to use a repository, or if there isn't one, work with infrastructure people to set one up - there are a number of software solutions that can help provide all the needed services.  The repository will typically issue persistent identifiers for digital objects and serve up data using a standarised communication protocol (usually) HTTP(S).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Accessible&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the user finds the required data, they need to know how they can be accessed, possibly including authentication and authorisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A1. (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardised communications protocol&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A1.1 The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A1.2 The protocol allows for an authentication and authorization procedure, where necessary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A2. Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But repository software can not be trusted to understand license text and thus cannot work out who to make non-open data available &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; - so what will (usually) happen is it will either just make the non-open data available only to the depositor and administrators. The default is to make it &lt;em&gt;Inaccessible&lt;/em&gt; via what repository people call &amp;quot;mediated access&amp;quot; - ie you have to contact someone to ask for access and then they have to figure out how to get the data to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the Australian Data Archive they have the &amp;quot;request access&amp;quot; part automated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4 - DOWNLOADING DATA&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To download open access data and documentation, click on the ‚ÄúDownload‚Äù button next to the file you are interested in. Much of the data in the ADA collection has controlled access, denoted by a red lock icon next to the file. Files with controlled access require you to request access to the data, by clicking on the ‚ÄúRequest Access‚Äù button.
&lt;a href="https://ada.edu.au/accessing-data/"&gt;https://ada.edu.au/accessing-data/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases the repository itself will have some kind of built in access control using groups, or licences or some-such. For example, the &lt;a href="https://alveo.edu.au/"&gt;Alveo&lt;/a&gt; virtual lab funded by NeCTAR in Australia, on which I worked, has a local licence checker, as each collection has a licence. Some licences just require a click-through agreement, others are associated with lists of users who have paid money, or are blessed by a group-owner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not citing Alveo as a much-used or successful service, it was not, overall, a great success in terms of uptake, but I think it has a good data-licence architecture; there is a licence-component that was separate from the rest of the system. The licence checking sits in front of the &amp;quot;Findability&amp;quot; part of the data and the API - not much of that data is available without at least some kind of licence that users have to agree to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://ptsefton.com/2021/06/11/faira/plantuml_Alveo.png" alt="Diagram"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pattern makes a clear separation between the licence as an abstract, identifiable thing, and a service to keep track of who holds the licence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question is, could we do something like this at national or global scale?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are part of the way there - we can authenticate users in a number of ways, eg by the Australian Access Federation (&lt;a href="https://aaf.edu.au/"&gt;AAF&lt;/a&gt;) and equivalents around the world, and there are protocols that allow a service to authenticate using Google, Facebook, Github et al. These all rely on variants of a pattern where a user of service &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; is redirected to an authentication service &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; where they put in their password or a one-time key, and whatever other mechanism the IT department deem necessary, and then are redirected back to service &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; with an assurance from &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; that this person is who they say they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we don't have (as far as I'm aware) is a general purpose protocol for checking whether someone holds a licence. A repository could redirect a web user to a Group Licence Server and the user could transact with the licence service, authenticate themselves (in whatever way that licence service supports) and then the licence service could check it's internal lists of who has what licence and then return it. If the license is just a click through then the user could to the clicking - or request access,or pay money or whatever is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update: 2021-06-16 This class of service would also be useful for provisioning access to things other than data - such as compute or other workspace resources. Making this a standard protocol means that these services could be offered by different organizations, yes we want national ones but for some kinds of sensitive data a community might want to run and control their own.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(We are aware of the work on FAIR Digital Objects and the &lt;a href="https://fairdo.org/"&gt;FDO Forum&lt;/a&gt; - it does say there that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FAIR Digital Objects (FDO) provide a conceptual and implementation framework to develop scalable cross-disciplinary capabilities, deal with the increasing data volumes and their inherent complexity, build tools that help to increase trust in data, create mechanisms to efficiently operate in the domain of scientific assertions, and promote data interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colleagues and I have started discussions with the folks there.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those of us who were around higher-ed-tech in the '00s in Australia will remember &lt;a href="https://slideplayer.com/slide/1514611/"&gt;MAMS&lt;/a&gt; - the Meta Access Management system - the leader James Dalziel was at all the eResearch-ish conferences talking about this shared federation (that would allow you to log in to other people's systems (we got that - it's the aforementioned AAF), with fantastic user stories about being able to log into a data repository and then by virtue of the fact that you're a female anthropologist, gain access to some cultural resources (we didn't get that bit). I remember &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/kent-fitch-137926"&gt;Kent Fitch&lt;/a&gt; then from the National Library, one of the team that build the national treasure &lt;a href="https://trove.nla.gov.au/"&gt;Trove üòÄ&lt;/a&gt; bursting that particular bubble over beers after one such talk. He asked: How do you identify an anthropologist? Answer - a university authentication system certainly can't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realised a long long time later that while you can't identify the anthropologists, or tell 'em apart from the ethnographers or ethnomusicologists etc that they &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; and make their own groups, via research projects, collaborations and scholarly societies. You &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; have a group that listed the members of a scholarly society and use that for certain kinds of access control, and you could, of course let the researchers self select people they want to share with - let &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt; set up &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if we had a class of stand-alone service where anyone could set up a group and add users to it? A project lead could decide on what is an acceptable way to authenticate, via Academic Federations like AAF or ORCID, public services like Github or Facebook etc and then add a list of users via email addresses or other IDs. And what if there was a way to auto-populate that group by linking through to &lt;a href="https://osf.io/"&gt;OSF&lt;/a&gt; groups, or Github organisations, Slack etc (all of which use different APIs and none of which know about licences in this sense as far as I know). This would be useful for groups of researchers who need access to storage, compute, and yes, datasets with particular licence provisions. There could be free-to-use group access for individuals and paid services for orgs like learned societies who can use the list to make deals with infrastructure providers for example. And there need not only be one of these services, they'd work well at a National level I think but could be more granular or discipline based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Does such a thing already exist? Did I miss it? Let me know in the comments below or on twitter - I'm @ptsefton)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could do this something like the way modern authentication services work with a simple hand-off of a user to an authentication service, but with the addition of licence URL, to a service that says - yep I vouch for this person they have a licence to see the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://ptsefton.com/2021/06/11/faira/plantuml_FAIRA.png" alt="Diagram"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above interaction diagram is purely a fantasy of mine. I'm not an Internet Engineer - so I have probably made some horrible errors, please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously this requires a trust-framework; repositories would have to trust the licence servers and vice-versa and these relationships would have to be time-limited and renewable. You wouldn't want to trust a service for longer than their domain registration for example in case someone else you don't trust buys the domain, that kind of thing. And you'd want some public key stuff happening so that transactions are signed (a further mitigation against domain squatters - they would presumably not have your private key).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is not an overly complicated application we're talking about - all access-controlled APIs already have to do some of this locally. It's the the governance - the trust federations that will take time and significant resources (so lets start now :-).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while we're on the subject of trust - this scheme would work in the same way most research does - with trust in the people working on the projects - typically they have access to data and are trusted to keep it safe. Being a member of a project team in health research, for example often involves joining a host organization as an honorary staff member, and being subject to all its policies and procedures. Some research groups have high levels of governance; people are identified using things like nursing registrations, and other certifications; some are ad-hoc collections of people identified by a PI using any old-email address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: for data that needs to be kept really really secure? Data that can never even be put on a hard drive and left on a bus - then this proposal is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the scheme for that data - that's where you'd be looking at a Secure eResearch Platform (SeRP) where the data lives in a walled garden and can be inspected only via a locked-down terminal application, or even stricter, you might only have secure on-site access to data that's air-gapped from any network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a sketch of some infrastructure. Essentially this is what happened inside Alveo - the question is can it be distributed so repositories can be de-coupled from authorization services?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This schematic is a high level view of research data management showing workspaces enabling research activities (collect, analyse, describe) linked to repositories in a continuous cycle. This is similar to the software development model of commit early and commit often but in this case, deposit well described objects often and re-use as required. Workspaces can include systems like Redcap, OwnCloud and other active work systems and they should be treated as ephemeral and dirty. Repositories can include systems like Zenodo and Figshare where FAIR objects are managed for long term preservation and re-use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ANSWER:  OCFL&lt;br /&gt;
' title='4' border='1'  width='85%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UTS has been an early adopter of the OCFL (Oxford Common File Layout) specification - a way of storing file sustainably on a file system (coming soon: s3 cloud storage) so it does not need to be migrated. I [presented on this at the Open Repositories conference] (https://eresearch.uts.edu.au/2019/07/01/OCLF.htm). PARADISEC has built a scalable and performant demonstrator using OCFL.
Completeness, so that a repository can be rebuilt from the files it stores
Parsability, both by humans and machines, to ensure content can be understood in the absence of original software
Robustness against errors, corruption, and migration between storage technologies
Versioning, so repositories can make changes to objects allowing their history to persist
Storage diversity, to ensure content can be stored on diverse storage infrastructures including conventional filesystems and cloud object stores&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an example of service connection in the CS3MESH4EOSC. In this schematic we can see a FAIR Description Service forming the bridge between the CS3MESH4EOSC services (workspaces) and various repositories. A FAIR description service uses linked-data to describe data and its context. The next slide shows some of what you might want to add to a Digital Object (data package) to make it Findable, Interoperable and Reusable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RO-Crate is method for describing a dataset as a digital object using a &lt;strong&gt;single linked-data metadata document&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lightweight approach to packaging research data with metadata - the examples here aid in the F, A, I and R in FAIR. For example ‚Äúhow can it be reused‚Äù means a data licence that specifies who can access, use and distribute data. And ‚ÄúHow was it made‚Äù is important for reuse and interoperability - think file formats, resolution etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Community effort - 40+ contributors from AU, EU and US.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can aggregate files and/or any URI-addressable content, with contextual information to aid decisions about re-use. (Who What When Where Why How).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uses Schema.org as the main ontology, with domain-specific extensions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has human readable summaries of datasets&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When your data is well described you can start thinking about higher level processes and workflows connecting workspaces to repositories. And your services can evolve over time as requirements change and systems improve without needing to transform your data first. Too often research data management infrastructures get caught up in the specific technologies / systems to be implemented without considering how an ecosystem of services can work as whole. If the previous architecture slide was a low level view of the CS3MESH4EOSC implementation then this is a higher level view of a possible architecture that connects workspaces to repositories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Provisioning
' title='8' border='1'  width='85%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going up another few levels we can see that the picture is incomplete. The environment of repositories and workspaces needs more services to actually form a functional system for end users. Going forward we need to think about how to do cross-service authentication of parties and authorization of access to resources,  and group membership; licensing, environment provisioning etc. In this way we can tie together the active workspaces and repository services into a cohesive application for end users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(See a &lt;a href="/2021/06/11/faira"&gt;blog post from Peter Sefton floating ideas about how we might close this gap specifically for data-access licenses&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RO-Crate is method for describing a dataset as a digital object using a &lt;strong&gt;single linked-data metadata document&lt;/strong&gt; which can have descriptions of files and resources that are local or remote, and can contain discipline-appropriate context for the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A human-readable description and preview can be in an HTML file that lives alongside the metadata&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this mean for repositories? It means that a repository can show the contents of a digital object using either a standard display library, or a customised one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Provenance and workflow information can be included - to assist in data and research-process re-use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this mean for repositories? Repositories will be able to launch software environments; if the digital object can be run in an emulator, or a notebook environment then there is potential to launch that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a forthcoming paper by Soiland-Reyes et al&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;WorkflowHub.eu&amp;gt; is a European cross-domain registry of computational workflows, supported by European Open Science Cloud projects, e.g. &lt;a href="https://www.eosc-life.eu/"&gt;EOSC-Life&lt;/a&gt;, and research infrastructures including the pan-European bioinformatics network &lt;a href="https://elixir-europe.org/"&gt;ELIXIR&lt;/a&gt;. As part of promoting workflows as reusable tools, WorkflowHub includes documentation and high-level rendering of the workflow structure independent of its native workflow definition format. The rationale is that a domain scientist can browse all relevant workflows for their domain, before narrowing down their workflow engine requirements. As such, the WorkflowHub is intended largely as a registry of workflows already deposited in repositories specific to particular workflow languages and domains, such as UseGalaxy.euand Nextflow nf-core .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Updated 2021-05-23 further minor punctuation changes]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was invited to speak at an RDA (Research Data Alliance) 'Infrastructure and Data Management Plans (DMPs)' webinar on May 18th as part of a panel talking about Data Management Plans and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are my slides for my five minutes of RDA-fame - with some notes about what I said, some things I forgot to say and some things I learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liz Stokes from ARDC asked me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Could I suggest that you focus on what people should expect from DMP infrastructure and talk about how infrastructure can encourage good data management practices?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me being me I took the &amp;quot;what people should expect&amp;quot; as an opportunity to reflect not just on current infrastructure but also on what's needed for the future; where the gaps are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Preamble&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found this session very useful. Recently I have been working on the &lt;em&gt;A-is-for-accessible&lt;/em&gt; in FAIR, looking at how do we provide access to non-open research data that requires a specific license agreement for access and use, usually for privacy, ethical or commercial reasons. The simplest approach to this that I can think of is to create data licences, which would have human readable licence terms, that apply to a certain group of people, and to let the data custodian or a particular non-open dataset decide how to manage these groups of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does the group consist of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A named list of project collaborators?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A click-through licence where we identify a person and then keep track of the fact they clicked it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A commercial arrangement like a subscription where downloads are available for a certain time?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A repository would not need to worry about all of that if we had a mechanism to pass a licence URL to a licence service and let &lt;em&gt;it&lt;/em&gt; sort it out - authenticate the user, then authorize data access or not based on their membership of a group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I spoke John Chodacki from the  &lt;a href="https://cdlib.org/"&gt;Califormnia Digital Library&lt;/a&gt;, standing in for Maria Praetzellis, talked about some work they're doing with field research stations and data management plans, using a Data Management Planning tool called DMPTool. One of Maria's slides showed a graph of how a data management plan links to publications, organisations, funders, datasets and you guessed it, &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt;, identified with standard researcher IDs - ORCIDs. Given that applications like DMPTool, and our home-grown ReDBox Data Management Platform are keeping track of both researcher (and potentially research participant) cohorts and data deposits - these applications might ALSO be able to do the authentication and authorization steps for other services which provision things; repositories that provision data and workspaces that provision services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My final slide I had prepared was about the need for cohort or group management services so we can give groups of people a license to access certain data. I have been sketching out potential software architectures for a couple of client projects that deal with this at internet-scale via standard ways of treating licences, it is worth exploring how that group management could be  developed in Data Management (Planning) applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The talk&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RDMPs need to be useful. There are a couple of dimensions to this - without using the dreaded ‚ÄúCarrot and stick‚Äù metaphor they can be useful in that they help you comply with organizational and funder requirements, but also, they could be useful as a focal point for getting access to services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a slide sent to me by Ian Duncan from the ARDC ‚ÄúData Lifecycle‚Äù project, circa 2016. Note the box top left labelled ‚ÄúProvisioning‚Äù - this was an exciting vision which we picked up and implemented at UTS. We added provisioning services to the open source RedBox research data management platform that heard about from Andrew Brazzati who talked just before me, which are now available to the whole community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Data Lifecycle project ‚Äùmorphed into‚Äù (Ian‚Äôs Words)  the  &lt;a href="https://www.raid.org.au/"&gt;Research Activity Identifier Service&lt;/a&gt; offered by ARDC - this addresses part, but not all of the Data Lifecycle vision - being able to identify activities is OK but what we really need is a way for cohorts of researchers, their support staff and other participants to be able to access resources. I‚Äôll come back to this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn‚Äôt include this in my presentation - but two of the other presenters did! It was drawn by Gerrad Barthelot at UTS following an architecture workshop with the eResearch team - building on the idea of Provisioning as the core useful service - which we learned about partly from the Data Lifecycle project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Research Data Lifecycles - recently &lt;a href="http://ptsefton.com/2021/04/07/rdmpic/index.html"&gt;I blogged a bit of a rant about the misuse of the term &amp;quot;lifecycle&amp;quot; and called out some issues with some of the ways research data cycles are often depicted as project-based cycles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a diagram that Marco La Rosa and I have been developing that tries to capture the infrastructure needed for Research Data Management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the key points of this diagram is that the  cyclical part of doing FAIR data management should be as rapid as possible, not something to be thought about only at the end of the project. We need to start thinking of &amp;quot;workspaces&amp;quot; as ephemeral places to collect/create, analyse and describe data and push that data into managed repository storage ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you accept this premise, then I think the thing you have to do as a data manager or custodian is work out where all these pieces are - do you have a DMP system yet? Is there a data repository at your institution? There's no point in having data policies or running training unless these bits of infrastructure are in place. And they often aren't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am an independent agent now - since the position of eResearch Support Manager was considered to be redundant by UTS. At least for now I am in a position to work on what &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; want to work on; for me that means looking for gaps - things that need doing in the research sector.  This next couple of slides  is not so much - what can you expect from infrastructure as in expect to be able to get right now, but what infrastructure we need to demand, to support, to ask institutions and projects like the Australian Research Data Commons to support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One area I'm putting time into is standardization for data interchange, particularly standardizing ways for turning piles of amorphous data into well described, packaged Digital Objects that can be Reused and moved between Interoperable systems (the I and R in FAIR) - via the &lt;a href="https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/"&gt;RO-Crate spec&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RO-Crate is a method for describing a dataset as a (FAIR) Digital Object using a &lt;strong&gt;single linked-data metadata document&lt;/strong&gt; that can be put in a zip file or download. This is a key enabler for infrastructure that allows for Interop; the I in FAIR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RO-Crate is seeing strong uptake in some communities and is being built in to systems such as &lt;a href="https://about.workflowhub.eu/How-to-make-a-workflow-RO-crate/"&gt;Workflow Hub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://news.aarnet.edu.au/from-endangered-languages-to-the-science-mesh-australian-researchers-are-helping-to-design-and-build-next-gen-petascale-fair-data-repositories/"&gt;PARADISEC&lt;/a&gt; and a new project I'm going to be involved in for Humanities and Social Science Data in Australia - more on that soon. And via the European Open Science Cloud (see the next slide).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don‚Äôt have a good way to define groups of people across institutional boundaries which is an essential part of provisioning services to research projects and provisioning non-open data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As noted above - Research Data Management (Planning) Tools could be one part of the infrastructure needed to identity data licences, who holds that licence - meaning that repositories that know the license for data can hand-off authorization and authentication to the DMP system. John Chodacki encouraged me to feed these ideas and requirements into DMPTool process, lets consider this post the first step in that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven McEachern from the Australian Data Archive and I also promised to follow up on the issue of data access/licencing.&lt;/p&gt;

We learned some things, got better at performing for the phone camera and our microphones and better at mixing and publishing the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Disclosure Gail's my wife. We got married; she proposed, I &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Ct0RQv6hiN8"&gt;accepted&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Ct0RQv6hiN8"&gt;I may I might - Is this the world's best marriage proposal acceptance song?&lt;/a&gt; (It did win a prize at a Ukulele festival for best song)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This post is littered with links to our songs, sorry but there are 58 of them and &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; has to link to them.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second quarter of 2020 Gail McGlinn and I went from playing and singing in community music events (jams, gigs, get togethers) at least once a week to being at home every evening, like everyone else.  Like lots of people we decided to put our efforts into home recording, not streaming cos that would be pointless for people with basically no audience, but we started making videos and releasing them under our band name &lt;a href="http://teamhappyband.com/"&gt;Team Happy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By release I mean &amp;quot;put on Facebook&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;sometimes remember to upload to YouTube&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is about that experience and what we learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Team Happy is the name we use to perform as a duo at open mic events and the odd community or ukulele festival. We were originally called &amp;quot;The Narrownecks&amp;quot; in honour of &lt;a href="https://www.visitnsw.com/destinations/blue-mountains/katoomba-area/katoomba/attractions/narrow-neck-lookout"&gt;where we live&lt;/a&gt;, for one gig, but then we found out there's another group with that name. Actually they're much better than us, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1676961009053252"&gt;just go watch them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming in to 2020 we already had a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4yZaVNUQp5iXCojJcT2rjA"&gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; and it had a grand total of two videos on it with a handful of views - as in you could count them on your fingers. It's still a sad thing to behold, how many views we have - but it's not about views it's about getting discovered and having our songs performed by, oh I dunno, Casey Chambers? Keith Urban? (Oh yeah, that would mean we'd need views. Bugger.) Either that or it's about our personal journey and growth as people. Or continuing to contribute to our local music communities in lockdown (which is what Gail says it's about.). Seriously though, we think &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N0HbdJZsgk"&gt;I called your name&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHc3JpDdw8Y"&gt;Dry Pebbles&lt;/a&gt; would go well on someone else's album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, in late March we got out our recording gear and started. While phone cameras are fine for the quality of video we need, we wanted to do better than phone-camera sound. (Here's an example of that sound from one of our first recordings on my song &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ceePoxf0_4"&gt;Seventeen&lt;/a&gt; - it's pretty muddy, like the lighting.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="video-container"&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2ceePoxf0_4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial attempts to get good audio involved feeding USB-audio from a sound mixer with a built in audio interface  (a Yamaha MX10) into the phone itself and recording an audio track &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; the video - but this is clunky and you only get two tracks even though the mixer has multiple inputs. We soon graduated to using a DAW - a Digital Audio Workstation with our mixer, still only two tracks but much less mucking around with the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is more or less what we ended up with for the first few weeks - We'd record or &amp;quot;track&amp;quot; everything on the computer and then use it again to mix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/png/XL9VQy8m47-_Jt7uBgvzb36KpSh0CfdCROz7csfOcfGaLc7ik--QLYajOnJAvVVdBlSZ00ldoVfJgS2Ap9C-A86JHwhyoOe9VlVHxT7eWFr07zxBN1XCf6AE7DOoPyb0ayeCeq2NKM27P3p1mCPZyY8ipl1PUs4BoiGSFwca8s6wZku-taBJLZIqRdWBK-5vXg-2AXOyBT_dN6V6vkWjPLykk9KVMNSyZ9TQdd9fWeQQAiZuW_-dy8qw3-aSwoQYRbRCNORnl6WbjS2K7C-L-e0xOMlPxBfXkss3SwFa4wb9uVxMlAXPyhUckQENNWdNgVr8dYJfThKERD6HPOJJt9przA6D6Sfu08J_3UCqho43rrUu3GF26y9fYpBCoG04hjSW1eRxPmHe_lTyAbqehoIlFCVLfJBM0zStk82Yw8ayB8JEcrSElm00"/&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;Our first-generation recording rig with annoying recording via a laptop&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a thing you have to do to audio files called &lt;em&gt;mastering&lt;/em&gt; which means getting them to a suitable volume level and dynamic range for distribution. Without it loud stuff is too quiet and quiet stuff is too quiet, and the music has no &lt;em&gt;punch&lt;/em&gt;. This was a complete mystery to me to start with so I paid for online services that use AI to master tracks - kind of but not really making everything louder. At some point I started doing it myself, beginning the long process of learning the mysteries of compression and limiting and saving money. Haven't &lt;em&gt;mastered&lt;/em&gt; it yet, though. Mastering is an actual profession, by the way and I'm not going to reach those heights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, we got a  new bit of gear, the Tascam Model 12 an all in one mixer-recorder-interface that lets you track (that is record tracks) without a computer - much easier to deal with. A bit later we got a Zoom H5 portable recorder with built in mics and a couple of extra tracks for instruments so we can do stuff away from home - this got used on our month-long holiday in March 2021. Well it was almost a month, but there was a Rain Event and we came home a bit early. These machines let you capture tracks, including adding new ones without touching the computer which is a big win as far as I am concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="video-container"&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4_9J4QlnCkw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer;  clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_9J4QlnCkw"&gt;Gail singing Closer to fine&lt;/a&gt; on The Strand in Townsville, in North Queensland, recorded on the H5 and (partly) mixed in the car on holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a bit, and depending on the level of lockdown we'd have guests around to visit and when that was happening, we kept our distance at either end of our long lounge room and used a phone camera and microphone at each end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/png/ZPBFIyCm5CVlxwzuxAI7CPhXPGVPSAiA5iOG1M-XIJMO7oLDju7ulvk-pj4r7hoKyFryahn-ssKJk0-jqU1b6RXzrn8dTxmEhPSJ_1gcsmzdAVi6W0GWco1li6QzCEI5AZ4ZQh988nx1k9Ke-mlEJt1ES4WVRHDyQwGDk5PTtfiYIuyvIZ_RoT9v8JrUFVEcv0OB9wJ6ZE4Ctvmp-71pJLEIZibrBqf8XxdIagoz4km_Klh6hGugU5v-ugeLof78knMfu_QUU1rSZOSPxYIlfSVrwdNHpOZS2Ynu4wId8tIWUPBFaolBDT9Wv5NxuTY9qzqKvzEoETaXqVEys6xkYLOd260od0ftiDFRla0mR1pCHu4ORw7dEUixWVxtclPfZ6EdKBFBW06G_RkNoe08ae1T9g33EUcQMU3cM3iV8AxFSGLLDP02BAKLhT4_"&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;Our second-generation recording rig with stand-alone laptop-free tracking &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new setup made it much easier to do overdubs - capture more stuff into the Model 12 and make videos each time, like on this song of mine &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EezBl_I549o"&gt;They Say Dancing&lt;/a&gt; where I overdubbed guitar and bass over a live track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what did we learn?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perfect is the enemy of Done. Well, we knew that, but if you've decided to release a song every week, even if you're away on a holiday, or there are other things going on then there's no time to obsess over details - you have to get better at getting a useable take quickly or you won't be able to keep going for a year or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practice may not make perfect, but it's a better investment than new gear, or doing endless takes with the cameras rolling. We got better at picking a song (or deciding to write one or finish one off), playing it for a week or two and then getting the take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simplify! We learned that to get a good performance sometimes it was better for only one of us to play or sing, that fancy parts increased the chance of major errors, meaning yet another take. If in doubt (like my harmony singing that's always in doubt) we're learning to leave it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody likes us! Actually we know that's not true, some of the songs get  hundreds of plays on Facebook but not many people actually click the like button, maybe twenty or so. But then you run into people in the supermarket; they say &amp;quot;love the songs keep it up&amp;quot;! And there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; quite a few people who listen every week on FB we just can't tell they're enjoying it. There are complex reasons for this lack of engagement - some people don't like to like things so that (they think) the evil FB can't track them. I think the default auto-play for video might be a factor too - the video starts playing, and that might not be a good time, so people skip forward to something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's kind of demoralizing that it is MUCH easier to get likes with pictures of the dog.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;div class="figure"&gt;
 &lt;img src="http://ptsefton.com/2021/04/08/lockdowns1/pup.png" alt="Puppies win every time"&gt;
 &lt;div class="caption"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our spoiled covid-hound, Floki - about 18 months old. Much more &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt;able on the socials than our music.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YouTube definitely doesn't like us. I figured that some of the songs we sang would attract some kind of Youtube audience - we often search to see what kinds of covers of songs are out there and thought others might find us the same way, but we get almost no views on that platform. I also thought that adding some text about the gear we used might bring in some views. For example we were pretty early adopters of the Tascam Model 12. I had tried to find out what one sounded like in real life before I bought, with no success - and I thought people might drop by to hear us, but I don't think Google/YouTube is giving us any search-juice at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Our personal favourites&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Favourite cover we did (and we actually agreee on this - Team Happy is NOT an ironic name) was &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQeS4fSSu7k"&gt;Colour my World&lt;/a&gt;. We'd just got the Tascam and Gail was able to double track herself - no mucking around with computers. We had fun that night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="video-container"&gt;

&lt;div class="caption"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQeS4fSSu7k"&gt;Colour my World&lt;/a&gt; - one of our fave covers to perform&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And my favourite original? Well i'm very proud of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnfcJGVVVhU"&gt;All L'Amour for you&lt;/a&gt; with lots of words and a bi-lingual pun - I wanted to do that on the local community radio just last weekend when we were asked in, but the host Richard 'Duck' Keegan kind of mentioned the aforementioned &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N0HbdJZsgk"&gt;I Called Your Name&lt;/a&gt; so we did that instead along with &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHc3JpDdw8Y"&gt;Dry Pebbles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ceePoxf0_4"&gt;Seventeen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gail's fave original? &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Ct0RQv6hiN8"&gt;I may I might&lt;/a&gt;, the song that snagged her the best husband in South Katoomba over 1.95m tall. And she likes the tear jerker &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkfbSeDXUVo"&gt;Goodbye Mongrel dog&lt;/a&gt; I wrote, on which she pays some pumpin' banjo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkfbSeDXUVo"&gt;Goodbye Mongrel dog&lt;/a&gt; - a song that says goodbye to a (deceased) Mongrel dog who went by the name of Spensa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Music-tech stuff and mixing tips&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who care, here's a roundup of the main bits of kit that work well. We've reached the point where there's actually nothing on the shopping list - we can do everything for the foreseeable future with what we have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have mentioned that we track using the Tascam Model 12 and the Zoom H5 - these are both great. The only drawback of the Zoom is that you can't see the screen (and thus the levels) from performance position. It also needed a better wind shield - I bought a dead-cat, shaggy thing to go over the mics that works if the wind is moderate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I bought the Tascam I thought it was going to be all analogue through the mixer stage like their Model 16 and Model 24, but no, it's all digital. I don't think this is an issue having used it but it was not something they made all that explicit at launch. There's a digital Zoom equivalent (the L12) which is a bit smaller, and has more headphone outputs but at the expense of having to do mode-switching to to access all the functions. I think the Tascam will be easier to use for live shows when those start happening again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For video we just use our phones - for a while we had matching Pixel 4XLs then a Pixel 5 which drowned in a tropical stream. Yes they're waterproof, those models, but not when they have tiny cracks in the screen. No more $1000 phones for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reaper.fm/"&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt; is bloody marvelous software. It's cheap for non-commercial use, incredibly powerful and extensible. I have not used any other Digital Audio Workstation other than Garage Band, that comes for free on the Apple Platform but as far as I can see there's no reason for non-technophobic home producers to pay any more than the Reaper fee for something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our mainstay mics are a slightly battered pair of &lt;a href="https://www.soundonsound.com/reviews/audio-technica-at2020"&gt;Audio Technica AT2020&lt;/a&gt;s - we had these for performing live with Gail's band U4ria - everyone gathered around a condenser mic, bluegrass style. For recording we either put one at either end of the room or mount them vertically in an X/Y configuration - 90¬∞ to get stereo. They're fairly airy and have come to be a big part of our sound. We tried some other cheap things that didn't work very well, and I got a pair of Australian &lt;a href="https://www.soundonsound.com/reviews/rode-m5"&gt;Rode M5&lt;/a&gt; pencil condenser mics, not expensive, that I hoped might be easier to mount X/Y but we didn't like them for vocals at all, though they're great on stringed instruments. We do have an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shure_SM58"&gt;SM58&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shure_SM57"&gt;SM57&lt;/a&gt; -- gotta love a microphone with a wikipedia page -- which see occasional use as vocal mics if we want a more rock 'n roll sound, or the guest singer is more used to a close-mic. And the SM57 for guitar amps sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tend to play our favourite acoustic instruments but when we have bass we use the Trace Elliot Elf amp which has a great compressor and a DI output (it can send a signal to the mixer/interface without going via the speaker). Sometimes we run the speaker and try not to let it bleed too much into the AT2020s, very occasionally we wear headphones for the first track and go direct so there's no bass bleed. I have done a bit of electric guitar with the Boss Katana 50 - to me it sounds good in the room that amp, but has not recorded well either via the headphone out or via an SM57. I get better results thru the bass amp. I don't have any kind of actual electric guitar &lt;em&gt;tone&lt;/em&gt; sorted though I have seen lot of videos about how to achieve the elusive &lt;em&gt;tone&lt;/em&gt;. Maybe one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that I wasn't expecting to happen - I dropped the top E of my little Made in Mexico Martin OOO Jr guitar to D (you know, like Keef) some time early in 2020 and it ended up staying there. Gives some nice new chord voicings (9ths mostly) and it's the same top 4 strings as a 5 string banjo with some very easy-to-grab chords. Have started doing it to Ukuleles too, putting them in open C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A note on the bass:&lt;/strong&gt;  Playing bass is fun (we knew that before we started) but mixing it so it can be heard on a phone speaker is a real challenge. One approach that helps is using an acoustic bass which  out of a lot more high frequency than a solid body electric this also helps because you don't have to have an amp on while you're tracking it live, but you can take a direct input from a pickup (or two) AND mic the bass giving you lots of signals with different EQ to play with.  I gaffa-taped a guitar humbucker into my Artist Guitars 5 string acoustic and it sounds &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic (ha!) trick I try to use for getting more high frequency for tiny speakers is to create a second track, saturate the signal with distortion and/or saturation effects to boost the upper harmonic content and then cut all the low frequency out and mix that so it can &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; be heard and &lt;em&gt;imply&lt;/em&gt; the fundamental bass frequency in addition to the real bassy bass. Helps if you have some bridge pickup or under-saddle pickup in the signal if those are available and if you remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also like to add some phaser effect that gives some motion in the upper frequencies - for example my &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItqXJ1zsvqg"&gt;Perfect Country Pop Song&lt;/a&gt; - too much phaser? Probably, but I can hear the bass on my phone and it &lt;em&gt;bounces&lt;/em&gt; :). Phaser is Team Happy's favourite effect, nothing says perfect country pop (which is what we are, right?) like a phaser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="video-container"&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ItqXJ1zsvqg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer;  clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItqXJ1zsvqg"&gt;Perfect Country Pop Song&lt;/a&gt; - is it perfect or merely sublime? (This one has a cute puppy in it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything I know about music production is from YouTube. Everything I know about song writing is from deep in my soul. Thank you for reading all the way to the bottom. Normal service will resume next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But first,  here's a rant about some modeling and diagramming styles and trends that I &lt;strong&gt;do not like&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took part in a fun Twitter thread recently &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FCTweedie/status/1359694360472821761"&gt;kicked off by Fiona Tweedie&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiona Tweedie
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FCTweedie"&gt;@FCTweedie&lt;/a&gt;
So my current bugbear is university processes that seem to forget that the
actual work of higher ed is doing research and/ or teaching. This &amp;quot;research
lifecycle&amp;quot; diagram from @UW is a stunning &lt;a href="https://www.washington.edu/research/research-home-page/research-lifecycle-main-t1-blowout-2/"&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;img alt="The UW MyResearch Lifecycle with the four stages: Plan/Propose, Setup, Manage, and Closeout" src="http://ptsefton.com/2021/04/07/rdmpic/uw.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this tweet Dr Tweedie has called out Yet Another Research Lifecycle Diagram That Leaves Out The Process Of You Know, Actually Doing Research. This process-elision happened more than once when I was working as an eResearch manager - management would get in the consultants to look at research systems, talk to the research office and graduate school and come up with a &amp;quot;journey map&amp;quot; of administrative processes that either didn't mention the actual DOING research or represented it as a tiny segment, never mind that it's, you know, the main thing researchers do when they're being researchers rather than teachers or administrators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least the consultants would usually produce a 'journey map' that got you from point A to Point B using chevrons to &amp;gt;&amp;gt; indicate progress and didn't insist that everything was a 'lifecycle'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Plan / Propose  &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Setup  &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Manage / Do Research &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Closeout
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all too commonly processes are represented using the tired old metaphor of a lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reminder: A lifecycle is a biological process; how organisms come into existence, reproduce and die via various means including producing seeds, splitting themselves in two, um, making love, laying eggs and so on.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's really stretching the metaphor to talk about research in this way - maybe the research outputs in the UW &amp;quot;closeout&amp;quot; phase are eggs that hatch into new bouncing baby &lt;em&gt;proposals&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regrettably, arranging things in circles and using the &amp;quot;lifecycle&amp;quot; metaphor is very common - see this Google image search for &amp;quot;Research Lifecycle&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://ptsefton.com/2021/04/07/rdmpic/research_lifecycle_search.png"/&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if the diagramming tools that are available to people are part of the issue - Microsoft Word, for example can build cycles and other diagrams out of a bullet list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I thought it would be amusing to draw the UW diagram from above as a set cogs but this happened - you can only have 3 cogs in a Word diagram.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://ptsefton.com/2021/04/07/rdmpic/cogs.png" alt="Attempt to use Microsoft Word to make a diagram 4 cogs for Plan/Propose, Setup, Manage, and Closeout but it will only draw three of them" &gt;
&lt;a id="main"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Research Data Management as a Cycle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I've got that off my chest let's look at research data management. Here's a diagram which is in fairly wide use, from &lt;a href="https://guides.library.ucsc.edu/datamanagement/"&gt;The University of California&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://ptsefton.com/2021/04/07/rdmpic/ResearchCycleUCSC.jpg" alt=""&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This image has a CC-BY logo which means I can use it if I attribute it - but I'm not 100% clear on the original source of the diagram - it seems to be from UC somewhere.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- There's a JCU version https://libguides.jcu.edu.au/research-data-management-toolkit --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marco used this one in some presentations we gave. I thought we could do better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good part of this diagram is that it shows research data management as a cyclical, recurring activity - which for FAIR data it needs to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I don't like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it is trying to show a project (ie grant) level view of research with data management happening in ONE spot on the journey. Typically researchers do research all the time (or in between teaching or when they can get time on equipment) not at a particular point in some administrative &amp;quot;journey map&amp;quot;. We often hear feedback that their research is a lifetime activity and does not happen the way administrators and IT think it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Archive&amp;quot; is shown as a single-step pre-publication. This is a terrible message; if we are to start really doing FAIR data then data need to be described and made findable and accessible ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big so-called lifecycle is (to me) very contrived and looks like a librarian view of the world with data searching as a stand-alone process before research data management planning. Not clear whether &lt;em&gt;Publication&lt;/em&gt; means articles or data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Data Search / Reuse&amp;quot; is a type of &amp;quot;Collection&amp;quot;, and why is it happening before data management planning? &amp;quot;Re-Collection&amp;quot; is also a kind of collection, so we can probably collapse all those together (the &lt;em&gt;Findable&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Accessible&lt;/em&gt; in FAIR).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs not clear whether Publication means articles or data or both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most research uses some kind of data storage but very often not directly; people might be interacting with a lab notebook system or a data repository - at UTS we arrived at the concept of &amp;quot;workspaces&amp;quot; to capture this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The &amp;quot;Minimum Viable FAIR Diagram&amp;quot;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marco and I have a sketch of a new diagram that attempts to address these issues and addresses what needs to be in place for broad-scale FAIR data practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of the FAIR principles suggest services that need to be in place; ways to &lt;em&gt;Find&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Access&lt;/em&gt; data. The I and R in FAIR are not something that can be encapsulated in a service, as such, rather they imply that data are well described for re-use and &lt;em&gt;Interoperation&lt;/em&gt; of systems and in &lt;em&gt;Reusable&lt;/em&gt; formats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it happens, there is a common infrastructure component which encapsulates &lt;em&gt;finding&lt;/em&gt;  data and &lt;em&gt;accessing&lt;/em&gt;; the repository.  Repositories are services which hold data and make it discoverable and accessible, with governance that ensures that data does not change without notice and is available for access over agreed time frames - sometimes with detailed access control.  Repositories may be general purpose or specialized around a particular type of data: gene sequences, maps, code, microscope images etc. They may also be ad-hoc - at a lab level they could be a well laid out, well managed file system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some well-funded disciplines have established global or national repositories and workflows for some or all of their data, notably physics and astronomy, bioinformatics, geophysical sciences, climate and marine science. Some of these may not be thought of by their community as repositories -  but according to our functional definition they are repositories, even if they are &amp;quot;just&amp;quot; vast shared file systems or databases where everyone knows what's what and data managers keep stuff organized. Also, some institutions have institutional data repositories but it is by no means common practice across the whole of the research sector that data find their way into any of these repositories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remember: data storage is not all files-on-disks&lt;/strong&gt;. Researchers use a very wide range of tools which may make data inaccessible outside of the tool. Examples include: cloud-based research (lab) notebook systems in which data is deposited alongside narrative activity logs; large shared virtual laboratories where data are uploaded; Secure eResearch Platforms (SERPs) which allow access only via virtualized desktops with severely constrained data ingress and egress; survey tools; content management systems; digital asset management systems; email (yes, it's true some folks use email as project archives!); to custom-made code for a single experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our general term for all of the infrastructures that researchers use for RDM day to day including general purpose storage is ‚Äúworkspaces‚Äù.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many, if not most &lt;em&gt;workspaces&lt;/em&gt; do not have high levels of governance, and data may be technically or legally inaccessible over the long term. They should not be considered as suitable archives or repositories - hence our emphasis on making sure that data can be described and deposited into general purpose, standards-driven repository services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is a snapshot of the core parts of an idealised FAIR data service. It shows the activities that researchers undertake, acquiring data from observations, instruments and by reuse, conducting analysis and data description in a working environment, and depositing results into one or more repositories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wanted it to show:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That infrastructure services are required for research data management - researchers don't just &amp;quot;Archive&amp;quot; their data without support - they and those who will reuse data need repository services in some form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That research is conducted using workspace environments - more infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img src="http://ptsefton.com/2021/04/07/rdmpic/new-diagram.png" alt="A work-in-progress sketch of FAIR research data management." &gt;
&lt;p&gt;We (by which I mean Marco) will make this prettier soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yes, there is a legitimate cycle in this diagram it's the FIND -&amp;gt; ACCESS -&amp;gt; REUSE -&amp;gt; DESCRIBE -&amp;gt; DEPOSIT cycle that's inherent in the FAIR lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things that might still be missing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some kind of rubbish bin - to show that workspaces are ephemeral and working data that doesn't make the cut may be culled, and that some data is held only for a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think's missing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thoughts anyone?  Comments below or take it up on twitter with @ptsefton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research data is special - like snowflakes - and I don‚Äôt mean that in a mean way, Research Data could be anything - any shape any size and researchers are also special, not always 100% aligned with institutional priorities, they align with their disciplines and departments and research teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs obvious that buying storage doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre doing data management well but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not worth restating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So &amp;quot;data storage is not data management&amp;quot;. In fact, the opposite might be true - think about buying a laptop - do you just get one that fits all your stuff and rely on getting a bigger one every few years? Or do you get a smaller main drive and learn how to make sure that your data's actually archived somewhere? That would be &lt;em&gt;managing&lt;/em&gt; data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And remember that not all research data is the same ‚Äúshape‚Äù as corporate data - it does not all come in database or tabular form - it can be images, video, text, with all kinds of structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far we‚Äôve just looked at things from an infrastructure perspective but that‚Äôs not actually why we‚Äôre here, us with jobs in eResearch. I think we‚Äôre here to help researchers do &lt;em&gt;excellent&lt;/em&gt; research with &lt;em&gt;integrity,&lt;/em&gt; AND we need to help our institutions and researchers manage &lt;em&gt;risk&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research which all research organizations  need to adhere to if we get ARC or NHMRC grants sets out some institutional responsibilities to provide infrastructure and training&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are risks associated with research data, reputational, financial and risks to individuals and communities about whom we hold data&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At UTS, we‚Äôve embraced the Research Data Management Plan - as a way to assist in dealing with this risk. RDMPs have a mixed reputation here in Australia - some organizations have decided to keep them minimal and as streamlined as possible but at UTS the thinking is that they can be useful in addressing a lot of the issues raised so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where‚Äôs the data for project X - when there‚Äôs an integrity investigation. Were procedures followed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much storage are we going to need?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;' title='10' border='1'  width='85%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the (defunct?) Research Data Lifecycle project that was conceived by the former  organizations that became the Australian Research Data Commons (ANDS, NeCTAR and RDSI) we came up with this architecture for a central research data management system (in our case we use the open source ReDBox system) loosely linked to a variety of research Workspaces, as we call them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan is that over time, researchers can plan and budget for data management in the short, medium and long term, provision services and use the system to archive data as they go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;' title='11' border='1'  width='85%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UTS has been an early adopter of the OCFL (Oxford Common File Layout) specificiation - a way of storing file sustainably on a file system (coming soon: s3 cloud storage) so it does not need to be migrated. I &lt;a href="https://eresearch.uts.edu.au/2019/07/01/OCLF.htm"&gt;presented on this at the Open Repositories conference&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;' title='12' border='1'  width='85%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And at the same conference, I introduced the RO-Crate standards effort, which is a marriage between the DataCrate data packaging work we‚Äôve been doing at UTS for a few years, and the Research Object project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;' title='13' border='1'  width='85%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We created the Arkisto platform to bring together all the work we‚Äôve been doing to standardise research data metadata, and to build a toolkit for sustainable data repositories at all scales from single-collection up to institutional, and potentially discipline and national collections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an example of one of many Arkisto deployment patterns you can read more on the &lt;a href="https://arkisto-platform.github.io/use-cases/"&gt;Arkisto Use Cases page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;' title='15' border='1'  width='85%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an example of an Arkisto-platform output. Data exported from one content management system into an archive-ready RO-Crate package, which can then be made into a live site. This was created for Ass Prof Tamson Pietsch at UTS. The website is ephemeral - the data will be Interoperable and Reusable (I and R from FAIR) via the use of RO-Crate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;' title='16' border='1'  width='85%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to higher-level concerns: I built this infrastructure for my chooks (chickens) - they have a nice dry box with a roosting loft. But most of the time they roost on the roof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know all too well that researchers don‚Äôt always use the infrastructure we build for them - you have to get a few other things right as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'&gt;
    &lt;img src='http://ptsefton.com/2021/01/28/rdm4aero/Slide17.png' alt='‚Ä¶

    &lt;img src='http://ptsefton.com/2021/01/28/rdm4aero/Slide18.png' alt='‚Ä¶ they will come, given the right training, incentives, support etc.
&lt;p&gt;' title='18' border='1'  width='85%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the big frustrations I have had as an eResearch manager is that the expectations and aspirations  of funders and integrity managers and so on are well ahead of our capacity to deliver the services they want, and then when we DO get infrastructure sorted there are organizational challenges to getting people to use it. To go back to my metaphor, we can‚Äôt just pick up the researchers from the roof and put them in their loft, or spray water on them to get them to move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CS3MESH4EOSC  -  Interactive and agile sharing mesh of storage, data and applications for EOSC - aims to create an interoperable federation of data and higher-level services to enable friction-free collaboration between European researchers.
CS3MESH4EOSC will connect locally and individually provided services, and scale them up at the European level and beyond, with the promise of reaching critical mass and brand recognition among European scientists that are not usually engaged with specialist eInfrastructures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like, you, know, they did with the copyright in publications. Not only did that industry work out how to take over copyright in research works, they successfully moved from selling us hard-copy resources that we could keep in our own libraries  to charging an annual rent on the literature - getting to the point where they can argue that they are essential to maintaining the scholarly record and MUST be involved in the publishing process even when the (sometimes dubious, patchy) quality checks are performed by &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt; who created the literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs up to research institutions whether this story repeats with research data - remember who you‚Äôre dealing with when you sign those contracts!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;img src='http://ptsefton.com/2021/01/28/rdm4aero/Slide25.png' alt='Some questions I will explore post UTS
How many research institutions in Australia have secure, scalable, sustainable Research Data repositories that support FAIR practices?
When are we going to have national repositories?
How many of the eResearch Platforms funded under various programs have sustainable data management stories? How much data is locked-up behind APIs and will be inaccessible if the software stops running?
&lt;p&gt;' title='25' border='1'  width='85%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 2010s the Australian National Data (ANDS) service funded investment in Metadata stores; one of these was the ReDBOX research data management platform which is alive and well and being sustained by QCIF with a subscription maintenance service. But ANDS didn‚Äôt fund development of Research Data Repositories.&lt;/p&gt;

The position was declared to be redundant under the &amp;quot;Voluntary Separation Program&amp;quot;. I guess the corporate maths works for UTS and it works for me. Thanks COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the third redundancy for me, and apart from fleeting feelings of uselessness, bitterness and mild despair being redundant, and of no use to anyone any more, has worked out fine for me in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've enjoyed working at UTS for the past nearly six years - this year was challenging for a lot of people, but working from home suited me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My colleagues and I built a good strong eResearch team, developed an eResearch strategy, and worked towards it, reporting as we went (see last year's &lt;a href="https://eresearch.uts.edu.au/eresearch/strategy-2019/"&gt;update on 2019&lt;/a&gt;). The team provides &amp;quot;full-stack&amp;quot; support - from racking and stacking servers to policy and strategy development; from one-on-one help with coding problems to faculty research committee meetings about data management planning. Every one of the team works directly with our stakeholders from research students to Deputy Vice Chancellors. As I leave, UTS has a new joined-up Research Systems Strategic Plan to which we all contributed ready to go, and the team has clear strategies for Research Data Management and computing support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why did I go for the &amp;quot;separation&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get a decent amount money, so I can have a break and have a think about what to do next, which I think will involve working on similar eResearch things internationally, nationally and for individual organizations.  Job number one, a small but I hope impactful international consulting gig is reaching the contract stage. I'll also keep working on the Research Object Crate (&lt;a href="http://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/"&gt;RO-Crate&lt;/a&gt;) spec and on the &lt;a href="http://ptsefton.com/2020/11/23/Arkisto.htm"&gt;Arkisto research platform&lt;/a&gt;. So, if you have any eResearching that wants doing please get in touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To spend more time with the family. Actually that's not really a major factor with the eight kids Gail McGlinn and I have between us all grown up, but the dog will appreciate having me around and we are taking a road trip North to Cairns in March with visits to family and friends, pandemic willing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid a &amp;quot;non-voluntary separation&amp;quot;; there are several not unlikely scenarios under which this might have happen in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have accepted an honorary position as a Visiting Fellow in the School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences, within the Faculty of Science so I can keep working with some of the research teams on data management and analytical pipelines, and will sit on an advisory committee that I'll tell you about next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core eResearch team had an end-of-2020/bye-bye-Petie get together. A couple of people couldn't make it but the rest of us chartered a double-decker and had a bit of a tour of the upper Blue Mountains followed by fully catered lunch. I can only hope that I came half way to the standard of the UTS Ariel Function Centre with my humble efforts at the stove, and some knife work from Pascal and Anselm (pictured below) on the side dishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;It's not often the Explorer Bus comes down this particular little street - we had to fight our way out through the overhanging trees with machetes. And I'd forgotten how much Coach Captain banter eclipses mere dad jokes - and our captain Michael has been coach captaining for 34 years so he has all the good patter. &lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research data from all disciplines has interest and value that extends beyond funding cycles and must continue to be managed and preserved for the long term. However much of the effort in eResearch goes into building systems which provide functionality and services that operate on data but which actually put data at risk, that is, by loading data into a particular tool so that  the data is not be easily retrievable if the service cannot be sustained, or, at worst, the data is lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arkisto (https://arkisto-platform.github.io/why/) approach is to work with a set of standards which make data available for long term access. Using the Oxford Common File Layout (OCFL) to organize data in a repository and Research Object Crate to describe data down to the file or even variable level Arkisto supports the safeguarding of data for the long term. A growing set of Arkisto-compatible software tools allow data ingest into repositories, and the creation of data discovery portals that connect data to analytical, visualisation and computing tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation we will introduce the standards based platform and show a number of examples from multiple disciplines of current Arkisto deployments, including an institutional Research Data Portal, a snapshot of the Expert Nation history project, crowd-sourced data from historical criminology , and the Pacific And Regional Archive for Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures (PARADISEC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the sector we build services  that operate on data but which actually put data at risk, that is, by loading data into a particular tool so that  the data is not be easily retrievable if the service cannot be sustained, or, at worst, the data is lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Arkisto (https://arkisto-platform.github.io/why/) approach is to work with a set of standards which make data available for long term access.
The closest emoji I could find to represent standards was this ‚Äústandard poodle‚Äù.  Previously I used a toothbrush - on the basis that ‚Äústandards are like toothbrushes, everyone wants to use their own‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;' title='4' border='1'  width='85%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first of the two core standards is the Oxford Common File Layout (OCFL) to organize data in a repository as a set of files. This approach is scalable indefinitely, and reduces the risk that data will be locked up in monolithic systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This diagram by Mike Lynch shows a series of different sized collections of data, each with a label. The labels (manifests)  in this case are purely about data integrity - and contain checksums. The bundles of data are the next level up as we move on to look at Standard number 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RO-Crate is the standard Arkisto uses for packaging and describing data sets. It is based on other standards:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JSON-LD - an encoding scheme for linked-data using the universally accepted JSON format (Javascript Object Notation) to encode information about Data Entities such as files and folders and Contextual Entities such as people, places, instruments, data licenses. Files can be described in detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schema.org is used as the main ontology, for classes and properties - it has coverage for all the basic Who What Where style metadata and is used by Google‚Äôs dataset search and a number of other projects. There are a few terms from other ontologies where Schema.org does not have coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RO-Crates may also have an HTML human readable summary of data. If you find a stray crate in your downloads folder it is easy to click on the HTML file and get a summary of what‚Äôs inside - they can also be hosted on the web using a plain-old webserver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A growing set of Arkisto-compatible software tools allow data ingest into repositories, and the creation of data discovery portals that connect data to analytical, visualisation and computing tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On important tool is Describo, a desktop (and soon to be online) tool for describing data using the RO-Crate standard. It created linked-data descriptions that can describe a dataset at the top level, and also individual files or variable inside files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two projects working on online version of Describo - one at UTS and on led by CERN working with the European National Research Networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;img src='http://ptsefton.com/2020/11/23/Arkisto/Slide10.png' alt='' title='10' border='1'  width='85%'/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Describo can be configured for use in specific domains, for example in cultural archives like PARADISEC. This slide shows how users can create entities and link them, and select from pre-defined data loaded in as part of the profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;' title='11' border='1'  width='85%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arkisto currently has two data discovery tools that index the contents of an OCFL repository so human and machines can discover data and connect to analytical, visualisation and computing tools. This is Michael Lynch‚Äôs diagram showing, from the left, how data can be ‚Äúdelivered‚Äù to a repository via standard tools (such as rsync) over SSH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An indexing process uses Solr (or another index like Elasticsearch) the RO-Crate metadata for objects builds an index that can be then used for search and faceted browsing over data. There is a user on the right, requesting access to a dataset  and a security guard checking her credentials - the user has the rights to see datasets marked with a *.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;img src='http://ptsefton.com/2020/11/23/Arkisto/Slide12.png' alt='' title='12' border='1'  width='85%'/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an example from the PARADISEC indexer. As per the Arkisto appraoacgh, PARADISEC site is data driven - objects are stored on disk in OCFL using RO-Crate for describe each research object. Indexing tools walk the OCFL filesystem looking for RO-Crates, then, using the crate metadata in addition to the OCFL inventory metadata construct appropriate indexes into the content. In this example we can see version 1 of this item and the metadata we get from the OCFL inventory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expert Nation Snapshot&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;' title='13' border='1'  width='85%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an example of faceted search interface - constructed using the Oni portal tool  developed at UTS - this is showing a data-export from the Expert Nation &lt;a href="https://expertnation.org/"&gt;https://expertnation.org/&lt;/a&gt; with the tagline ‚ÄúUniversities, War and 1920s &amp;amp; 30s Australia‚Äù led by  Associate Professor &lt;a href="https://www.uts.edu.au/staff/tamson.pietsch"&gt;Tamson Pietsch&lt;/a&gt; - who asked us to create an archive of the state of the dataset to support a book. We are working with Pietsch‚Äôs team to configure the portal to be useful in exporting the data. The SectorName facet is particularly important; it shows that the health sector was by far the biggest employer of returned service people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;' title='14' border='1'  width='85%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is another dataset - this time we are looking at an RO-Crate sitting on a plain old web site  (not a search portal). This is a screenshot of a map with a time-window function showing where one Laura Adams was convicted of 42 offences between 1918 and 1942. The power of the Arkisto platform, based on Standards is that adding this kind of functionality to other collections with geographical features in it is a matter of writing a few simple bits of code - the component can be re-used because the data and metadata use the RO-Crate standard (which in turn is built on other standards).The data in this demonstrator came from Alana  Piper‚Äôs &lt;a href="https://criminalcharacters.com/"&gt;Criminal Characters&lt;/a&gt;  project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;' title='15' border='1'  width='85%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a screenshot of geographical data about a single offender‚Äôs sentences that has been exported in to the Time Layered Cultural Map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are working on making this an automated service so that any Arkisto portal can be configured to display relevant geo-data but also to be able to export it for analysis to other tools via APIs including at large scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researcher, Dr Alana Piper says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analytical possibilities here would be uploading all offenders in bulk and
comparing the 'range' results to determine what types of offences or other
factors are associated with higher/lower levels of mobility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A modern catalog driven from OCFL and RO-Crate. This is the landing page built from the content indexed into elastic search. We can see the number of collections, items, contributors and universities at a glance. There are controls for jumping to a specific item or collection and a simple auto complete search for quickly finding known content. The bottom half is a dynamic list of the most recently updated items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PARADISEC has viewers for various content types: video and audio with time aligned transcriptions, image set viewers and document viewers (xml, pdf and microsoft formats). We are working on making these viewers available across Arkisto sites by having a standard set of hooks for adding viewer plugins to a site as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To conclude:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arkisto is a flexible research platform which can be used to assemble  a variety of data pipelines, for a variety of disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emphasis in on FIRST keeping data safe and re-usable by storing and describing it using standards, so that in the absence of budget and resources to maintain complex virtual labs the data are still available for re-use, and THEN to use our growing set of interoperable tools to build data hubs, with re-usable data viewer plugins and standards-based interoperable analytical services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are active projects under way at the Universities of Melbourne and University of Technology Sydney across a wide range if disciplines and we are seeking funding to enhance the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

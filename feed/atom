    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This blog turned 20 this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I mostly use this site to put up what Simon Willison calls &lt;a href=&quot;https://simonwillison.net/2023/Aug/6/annotated-presentations/&quot;&gt;annotated conference presentations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2024/06/24/update/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; like &lt;a href=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2024/06/24/update/2024/06/04/open-repositories-2024-pilars/&quot;&gt;this recent one from June&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the projects or institutions I&#39;ve worked for don&#39;t bother to maintain their websites over time, but with my own site I still have access to (most of) the stuff I&#39;ve done in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s down to only a few posts a year for the last several years, but &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; I&#39;ll start putting more things here so the Large Language Models (The &amp;quot;AIs&amp;quot;) have some fresh content to feed on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking iof the AIs, people have been asking me and my team about using AI to create metadata for ages, so I thought I&#39;d give it a go here. I used another LLM to help me write a script to use GPT4.0 to categorise my posts using using the set of categories you see on the home page. It seemed to do an OK job, but managed to go well off piste and tag &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:8080/2013/07/26/4a-data-management-acquiring-acting-on-archiving-and-advertising-data-at-the-university-of-western-sydney/&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; with &amp;quot;Research Data Pokémon_mgmt&amp;quot; - making up its own tag. I like that so I&#39;m keeping it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2024/06/24/update/image.png&quot; alt=&quot;Alt text&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This site started in 2024 using &lt;a href=&quot;https://jtauber.com/leonardo/&quot;&gt;Leonardo&lt;/a&gt;, a Python-based blog engine which required a server to be running. In 2007 I moved it to Wordpress, which I was using for lots of other sites at work and hosted it with the same provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015 I started working at UTS; we got sick of the constant upgrades and the overhead of running a Wordpress instance for the eResearch website and ported that site to &lt;a href=&quot;https://getpelican.com/&quot;&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;, a tool which produces static web sites that don&#39;t need a database and ongoing maintenance like Wordpress, so I migrated ptsefton.com at the same time (and I am now noticing that I missed a few bits in that process).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Static site generators, of which there are hundreds, typically work by transforming text files in markdown format into HTML files that can be hosted with your images and other files without needing anything running on a server (except a web server). The UTS eResearch team evaluated a number of static site generators at the time - and I recall them all being a bit annoying in various ways but Pelican was the least so, partly because we were a Python Shop, as they say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some time after 2015 I realised that I didn&#39;t even need to pay for hosting, and moved the site to github pages where it is as of mid 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New tool - 11ty&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I&#39;ve decided to update the site to use a Javascript framework called Eleventy, AKA 11ty, which I&#39;ve been using in some projects for work. It&#39;s (currently) annoying me less than Pelican, and I&#39;ve been home by myself for a week while Gail is away, so I can spend evenings playing with it and learning how it all works. I didn&#39;t even consider Hugo which we also use for work or Jekyll which is very widely used, as both of those have &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; annoyed me. And this is my site, so I don&#39;t want to be annoyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.11ty.dev/&quot;&gt;11ty&lt;/a&gt; is very flexible (that&#39;s their thing, the 11ty developers) but for something where you can use any templating engine and you can mix code into every nook and cranny, it has some perplexing hard-wired behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a built in thing where you use &amp;quot;tags&amp;quot; to classify things and these &amp;quot;tags&amp;quot; cause 11ty to make &amp;quot;collections&amp;quot;. Here&#39;s the (not very clear) explanation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While pagination allows you to iterate over a data set to create multiple templates, a collection allows you to group content in interesting ways. A piece of content can be a part of multiple collections, if you assign the same string value to the tags key in the front matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take care to note that tags have a singular purpose in Eleventy: to construct collections of content. Some blogging platforms use Tags to refer to a hierarchy of labels for the content (e.g. a tag cloud).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.11ty.dev/docs/collections/&quot;&gt;https://www.11ty.dev/docs/collections/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have indeed taken care to note this, and it&#39;s annoying, because I&#39;d rather Eleventy didn&#39;t use a term like &amp;quot;tag&amp;quot; to mean &amp;quot;collection&amp;quot; and then to bake this in to the code; what if I have a lot of content from another site that used &amp;quot;tag&amp;quot; in the other sense? Either make it configurable like all the other configurable things you&#39;re proud of, or use something that &lt;em&gt;won&#39;t&lt;/em&gt; clash with what &amp;quot;some blogging platforms do&amp;quot;, preferably something like, say &lt;code&gt;_11ty_collection&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;collection&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also weird (to me) is the thing where all your actual documents are considered to be &amp;quot;templates&amp;quot; as well as the things I would call templates, such as the generic layouts for the pages on the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing that took me a significant amount of time to configure was working out how to co-locate  posts and the images that go with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eleventy is not unusual in making this difficult. For some reason, most of these static site generators that I&#39;ve seen don&#39;t simply copy images used in a post from the folder where you write the post through to a folder in the output; the designers think it&#39;s a good idea to put all your images &lt;em&gt;over there&lt;/em&gt; somewhere. I found a Github issue about this which led me to try out an unreleased image plugin which didn&#39;t really do what I wanted. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/issues/2428#issuecomment-2184485821&quot;&gt;my contribution to that issue&lt;/a&gt; showing what I ended up after a few hours of frustration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is once I worked out I needed to do it, adding that bit of dodgy code was super-easy to do, as have been most of the other things I&#39;ve wanted like adding support for markdown footnotes&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2024/06/24/update/#fn2&quot; id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, or putting in an Atom feed, the usual things. These are simple to add and configure. Full marks for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously I have spent time working with &amp;quot;themes&amp;quot; to add styling and structure to the site with time I didn&#39;t bother instead of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s still using (almost) the same colour scheme as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20040604021801/http://ptsefton.com/blog/&quot;&gt;first version&lt;/a&gt;. Like a stopped calendar, pink and yellow comes back into fashion every so often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2024/06/24/update/image-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Alt text&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Comments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been using Disqus comments for years but I&#39;m locked out of my account and I can&#39;t reset my password cos it won&#39;t send me an email to that account, but there&#39;s no email support unless I&#39;m on a paid plan, but I can&#39;t start a paid plan because I&#39;m locked out of my account. I&#39;m thinking of screen-scraping the old comments but for now they&#39;ll just be missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, if you&#39;re reading this then the site has been migrated. I&#39;m assuming if you&#39;re here then you&#39;re likely to have a github.com account and that the feed is working. Leave a comment to let me know you&#39;re out there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Five ways RO-Crate data packages are important for repositories&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presented at: The 19th International Conference on Open Repositories, June 3-6th 2024, Göteborg, Sweden&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Session: Presentations: Integrations for Research Data Management&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time: 05/June/2024: 11:00 - 12:30 · Location: Drottningporten 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Sefton*, Stian Soiland-Reyes**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*University of Queensland, Australia; **The University of Manchester, UK&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research Object Crate is a linked data metadata packaging standard which has been widely adopted in research contexts. In this presentation, we will briefly explain what RO-Crate is, how it is being adopted worldwide, then go on to list ways that RO-Crate is growing in importance in the repository world:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uploading of complex multi-file objects means RO-Crate is compatible with any general-purpose repository that can accept a ZIP file (with some coding, repository services can do more with RO-Crates).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download for well-described data objects complete with metadata from a repository rather than just a ZIP or file with no metadata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using RO-Crate metadata reduces the amount of customisation that is required in repository software, as ALL the metadata is described using the same simple, self-documenting linked-data structures, so generic display templates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sufficiently well-described RO-Crates can be used to make data FAIR compliant, aiding in Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reusability thanks to standardised metadata and mature tooling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you’re looking for a sustainable repository solution, there are tools which can run a repository from a set of static files on a storage service, in line with the ideas put forward by Suleman in the closing keynote for OR2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof=&quot;http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2024/06/05/open-repositories-2024-ro-crate/Slide01.png&quot; alt=&quot;Uploading of complex multi-file objects … :: &quot; title=&quot;Slide: 1&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Uploading of complex multi-file objects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RO-Crate [1], [2] is a data packaging format and can be used to put multiple data files together with their metadata into a package such as a ZIP, tar or disk image file. This means that as long as your repository can handle a ZIP file it can take RO-Crates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RO-Crates enable data to travel with metadata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond simply allowing the upload of opaque RO-Crates, there are opportunities for repository software to recognise metadata in an uploaded package and to pre-populate built-in metadata forms and/or datastores. This is not a pattern the authors have seen widely implemented in comprehensive institutionally focussed repositories, although at the time of writing it is being explored in Dataverse and InvenioRDM/Zenodo. We would encourage repository developers to explore this further, particularly those working with research data. RO-Crate support is increasing in research-domain repositories; e.g. RO-Crate upload with metadata extract is supported by WorkflowHub and ROHub).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof=&quot;http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2024/06/05/open-repositories-2024-ro-crate/Slide02.png&quot; alt=&quot;… is already supported even if the repo does not speak RO-Crate :: &quot; title=&quot;Slide: 2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the design features of an RO-Crate is that as it can be “just a ZIP file” it can be used with any old repository that can handle ZIP files. The JSON file can also be uploaded separately. As RO-Crate adoption increases, the repository may be able to start to use the RO-Crate metadata it already has. You can/will have heard from Dieuwertje Bloemen here at OR2024 that DataVerse has support for RO-Crate metadata preview and building import/export mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RO-Crate specification described a method of packaging data in a folder, which can be zipped, with any kind of file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This slide shows a folder of data, including a file with a typical obscure file name based on a timestamp (in this case created by a Dropbox upload from a digital camera). The RO-Crate Metadata file, in JSON Linked Data Format, can describe files. This one has a name (i.e. a title) for the file; “Cute puppy”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A human-readable description and preview (ro-crate-preview.html) can be in an HTML file that lives alongside the metadata. This slide shows an HTML view of the data that shows the image with its metadata, including the Schema.org &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; (equivalent to a Dublin Core &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt;) for the file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasingly, research repository infrastructure is accepting RO-Crate input - this screenshot from WorkflowHub [documents the upload API[(https://about.workflowhub.eu/developer/ro-crate-api/) for submitting RO-Crate packaged descriptions of scientific workflows to the system. These can then be downloaded by others for reuse. Here, RO-Crate allows bypassing of the traditional “title, author, license, description” fields (rendered from the crate), as well as permitting user extensions on metadata to be kept in the repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof=&quot;http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2024/06/05/open-repositories-2024-ro-crate/Slide06.png&quot; alt=&quot;2.  RO-Crate is a packaging format suitable for downloads :: 2. :: &quot; title=&quot;Slide: 6&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;RO-Crate is a packaging format suitable for downloads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the perennial problems with downloads is that once a user has the data, it often does not come with metadata as shown on the landing page, or if present it is in an ad hoc or specialised format. RO-Crate solves this by specifying an extensible way to put linked-data metadata with data assets and to provide an HTML page or small website with the data to explain it. Thus data travels &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; its metadata and can be made human-readable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RO-Crate download is already available in many data repositories. Examples include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;opi=89978449&amp;amp;url=https://workflowhub.eu/&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwi_wuuK9qmGAxWkAHkGHb9hDngQFnoECBgQAQ&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0Mgw-ytkMOTMLIPdH1AorW&quot;&gt;WorkflowHub&lt;/a&gt;: A registry for describing, sharing and publishing scientific computational workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rohub.org&quot;&gt;ROHub&lt;/a&gt;: A  repository of Earth Science datasets and computational methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://data.ldaca.org.au&quot;&gt;Language Data Commons of Australia data portal&lt;/a&gt;: entirely built on RO-Crates, the underlying data consists of crates-on-disk and the API is based on RO-Crate metadata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wildlive.senckenberg.de/&quot;&gt;Senckenberg Wildlive portal&lt;/a&gt;: exposes metadata about automatic photo captures of endangered animals using RO-Crate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dataverse: at the time of writing, RO-Crate downloads are in development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will encourage developers from other repository platforms to follow the Dataverse project’s lead and add RO-Crate support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every repository implementer should add FAIR Signposting – just a couple of HTTP headers – this means machines can go from an HTML landing page to the actual download without guesswork – or even better – to an RO-Crate! I’m sure you’ll hear this mentioned in one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.conftool.net/or2024/index.php?page=browseSessions&amp;amp;presentations=show&amp;amp;search=herbert&quot;&gt;talks&lt;/a&gt; by Herbert van de Sompel and colleagues, such as the one on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.conftool.net/or2024/index.php?page=browseSessions&amp;amp;form_session=475#paperID246&quot; title=&quot;FAIRiCat: Supporting Discovery of a Repository&#39;s Interoperability Affordances&quot;&gt;FAIRiCat&lt;/a&gt;. Again, DataVerse is ahead of the curve and has already implemented this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned above, data should travel with the metadata – one example of this from the WorkflowHub is how other services like the LifeMonitor retrieves the RO-Crate and then looks for custom annotations in the metadata to pick up and connect to the testing infrastructure.  This was only possible because RO-Crate is extensible - you are not trapped with whatever 25 properties we’ve selected. The vessel is still RO-Crate, the repository didn&#39;t need to add anything to support the LifeMonitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the key benefits of linked-data metadata over previous ‘legacy’ approaches, is that multiple vocabularies can be combined into a single metadata document in a way that is not possible with, say MARC, or MODS XML, and that all these vocabularies can use the same syntax and approach to describing data. This means that a simple generic RO-Crate viewer can be used to visualise any metadata whether it is basic “Who, What, Where” metadata (like Dublin Core) or domain-specific metadata like the RO-Crate metadata profile (https://w3id.org/ldac/profile) used by the Language Data Commons of Australia. This can be displayed alongside the core RO-Crate metadata without any expensive configuration or coding. If the recommendations are followed, the RO-Crate metadata terms are self-documenting, e.g. all the Language Data Commons terms which use a Schema.org Style approach, are defined here: https://w3id.org/ldac/terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This slide is a repeat of one we used last year – this screenshot is a bit of (undated) DSpace documentation found following a tip from Kim Sheppard – we have included it here to illustrate that storing additional metadata (in this case METS) for an object was done by convention – it had to be stored in a special file called METS.xml. Using a linked-data system means that we no longer have to do this kind of thing – there’s still one magic file name in RO-Crate but it’s only one for the metadata and one for the HTML preview – everything else is labelled and extensible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an example of a data object in RO-Hub, which has a variety of files described in the object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This site does not need to have multiple plugins for different kinds of data, as linked data has a generic structure. We saw another example of how the generic structure can be rendered in the opening example with a picture of Sefton&#39;s dog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now we can tell all these research software developers, I know you like making new file formats, and I would love to support that in my repository, so could you perhaps use RO-Crate as the basis for making that format? Then we can pull out all the boring stuff, even for new file extensions, we just detect it’s a ZIP file and look for that magic file. If it says it’s an RO-Crate we’ll believe you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The availability of RO-Crate editing tools opens the way for repository software to focus on access and discoverability.
We argue that the core functionality of a repository is keeping data safe and making it available with appropriate access controls (remember, not all data can be made Open Access - the A for accessibility in FAIR is about giving the right people (or other agents) access to the right data). RO-Crates require clear licensing statements to travel with data, and we will demonstrate how these have been integrated into access-control systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an opportunity, if RO-Crate is adopted as an interchange format, for the metadata editing functions (and authorisation) functions of a repository to be decoupled from it so the editor components for a particular metadata profile can be shared between repository instances, or handled in a more distributed architecture than in typical current repositories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://describo.github.io/describo-users.html&quot;&gt;Describo&lt;/a&gt; website mentions this integration with the Dataverse repository where the Describo RO-Crate editor can be used to enter metadata. The pattern is potentially very powerful - separate the creation of metadata from the repository so that repositories can focus on data retention and multiple other applications can be built for use by researchers or other users – closer to or embedded in systems they are already using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a repository to keep data safe and serve it using persistent identifiers, RO-Crates help make data FAIR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RO-Crate is increasingly being used to describe the provenance [3] of derived data in such a way that the workflows/computation that produced it can be re-run automatically to validate it, or as a basis for new research. This might be a button on a repository to run a bioinformatics workflow, or re-run a Jupyter notebook that produces a set of plots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RO-Crate helps to enable FAIR research practice; RO-Crates can describe inputs, outputs and code in any combination to record research processes, and can be used to provision services.&lt;/p&gt;

Alex is working with the Language Data Commons of Australia team to make RO-Crate Profiles that can describe code, not just in terms of its authorship, language and inputs and outputs, but the (usually virtual) execution environment and hardware requirements needed to run it. This is a key step forward in the Interoperability and Reuse of data called for by the FAIR principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are tools which can run a repository from a set of static files on a storage service, in line with the ideas put forward by prof Suleman at OR 2023.
The team at the Language Data Commons of Australia, with partner institutions and colleagues, has been working to produce a set of tools for building Archival Repository software stacks that is based on a principled approach to keeping data safe, based on the principles presented in the Arkisto website[4] and more recently at &lt;a href=&quot;https://w3id.org/ldac/pilars&quot;&gt;https://w3id.org/ldac/pilars&lt;/a&gt; the core idea is that a collection of RO-Crates in a storage service can be the basis of a repository – either using a simple on-disk directory layout or something more complicated such as an Oxford Common File Layout (OCFL) specification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Five ways RO-Crate data packages are important for repositories&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research Object Crate is a linked data metadata packaging standard which has been widely adopted in research contexts. In this presentation, we will briefly explain what RO-Crate is, how it is being adopted worldwide, then go on to list ways that RO-Crate is growing in importance in the repository world:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uploading of complex multi-file objects means RO-Crate is compatible with any general-purpose repository that can accept a zip file (with some coding, repository services can do more with RO-Crates)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download for well-described data objects complete with metadata from a repository rather than just a zip or file with no metadata&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using RO-Crate metadata reduces the amount of customisation that is required in repository software, as ALL the metadata is described using the same simple, self-documenting linked-data structures, so generic display templates&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sufficiently well-described RO-Crates can be used to make data FAIR compliant, aiding in Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reusability thanks to standardised metadata and mature tooling&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you’re looking for a sustainable repository solution, there are tools which can run a repository from a set of static files on a storage service, in line with the ideas put forward by Suleman in the closing keynote for OR2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Schema.org style Schema (SOSS) specifies a metadata vocabulary of Classes and Properties, based on the RO-Crate specification&#39;s use of Schema.org classes.
An RO-Crate Profile has (at least) a document that explains how metadata entities from the Schema are used for a particular purpose.
An RO-Crate Mode is a set of lightweight syntactic rules for combining SOSS Classes, Properties and DefinedTerms, expressed in a JSON file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crate-O RO-Crate Editor Mode Files are editor configurations that implement RO-Crate Metadata Profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration files are intended to form the basis of an approach for describing RO-Crate editor behaviour and can be used for RO-Crate validation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial versions of this work were based on the Describo Profiles (which vary between versions of Describo) used to configure the Describo family of RO-Crate editing tools, currently maintained by Marco La Rosa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2024/06/05/open-repositories-2024-crate-o/Slide07.png&quot; alt=&quot;Embed Crate-O in your own Vue app :: Functionalities include everything Crate-O can do except anything to do with file handling (load/save crate, read files, manage profiles, etc.) :: Published in NPM, just do npm install and import the component in your Vue app :: As a component, it should run in any modern web browser :: Crate-O is developed with Vue 3 framework and exposes the Vue component CrateEditor that can be imported as a library by any Vue app. ::  :: CrateEditor UI part :: &quot; title=&quot;Slide: 7&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crate-O is a single-page front-end web app developed using the Vue Javascript framework. Vue app is built by composing and nesting modular structures called components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main part Crate-O is then bundled in the CrateEditor component (highlighted in red) that allows a user to view, add, edit and delete properties of an entity, add and delete entities, and navigate and browse all entities in the crate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CrateEditor component is exported as EMAScript Module and can be imported into any Vue web app by adding Crate-O as dependency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default main app (for showcasing) only runs in Chrome-based browsers because it requires the &lt;code&gt;showDirectoryPicker&lt;/code&gt; method from File System API to access (read/write) a directory on a local machine. The feature is still experimental and only available in Chrome-based browsers. However, the CrateEditor component itself does not require that feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This slide illustrates the very basic example of embedding Crate-O CrateEditor in any Vue app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The example shows a Vue Single-File Component (SFC) (*.vue)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside the &amp;lt; import the CrateEditor component from the Crate-O package&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initialise all required variables&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add the &amp;lt;crate-editor&amp;gt; tag inside the &amp;lt;template&amp;gt; and pass in the data via the attributes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;crate: a plain js object in json-ld format, usually is the result of JSON.parse() of the string content of ro-crate-metadata.json file&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mode: a plain js object conforming to the ro-crate-mode syntax&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data can be imported into Crate-O using spreadsheets - this is an efficient way to create metadata for collections of objects. Spreadsheet skills are common and many projects have already been described using spreadsheets to describe and manage files, we work with data custodians to standardize their approach to this so that they can create rich linked-data metadata.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented at: The 19th International Conference on Open Repositories, June 3-6th 2024, Göteborg, Sweden&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Session: Presentations: Open and Sustainable Infrastructure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time: 04/June/2024: 13:30 - 15:00 · Location: Drottningporten 1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We present a toolkit for sustainable Archival Repositories, with metadata and storage standards as well as APIs and data portals, that can be assembled by communities with various levels of resourcing into repository solutions at a variety of scales, with fallback to offline operation. Tools are designed to work in low-resource environments, allowing communities to have agency and control over their materials. We prioritise sustainability, simplicity, standardisation, linked-data description and clear licensing over user interface features, in line with Suleman’s keynote presentation at OR2023, while still being able to drive rich, full-featured services when resources allow and fall back to a sustainable core if needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the data we work with is subject to Indigenous Cultural Intellectual Property (ICIP) rights, controlled by First Nations peoples guided by Indigenous data sovereignty principles; we must ensure it is handled in a conscionable and culturally responsible manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making data Accessible does not always mean Open Access – under both research ethics and the CARE and FAIR principles, data by and about humans needs access control and licensing. Our framework deals with these issues and is built from the ground up to be “as open as possible, as closed as needed”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: Since the abstract was submitted we have adopted the name “Protocols” for the use in work we are doing on tools for FAIR and CARE adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The area of the strategy we’re focusing on for this presentation is highlighted – tools, standards and technical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The activities we are undertaking are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop shared tools, standards and technical infrastructure to help data stewards care for data for the long term&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build data portals with useful search functions and lightweight technical structures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Towards the following outcomes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standards and tools are available and being applied by data stewards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good governance and standardised, distributed storage of data helps
preserve data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discovering and locating language data is easy via linked portals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t need to define the term “Repository” at the Open Repositories conference, but we do need to define a term that we use at LDaCA when we talk about Repositories – we use the inclusive term “Archival Repository” to refer to systems designed to keep data for the long term. We do this to avoid drawing boundaries around what is a “repository” vs an “archive” or a Digital Preservation system and to include as many practitioners as possible in the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first implementation of this stream of work was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://data.research.uts.edu.au/&quot;&gt;UTS Research Data Portal&lt;/a&gt; – this has not been updated for a while due to staffing changes at the university and a lack of ongoing governance that made the data repository dependent on individual people (three of whom are authors of this paper and no longer work for UTS), but as of mid-2024 it is being renovated and revitalised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This screenshot shows what an LDaCA site looks like; a typical data-discovery portal. Underneath is not a typical (by Open Repositories standards) repository solution like Dspace, Innvenio or EPrints, all of which are more or less monolithic architectures. Following the implementation protocols we will discuss below, data is very much considered separately from the application used to provide views of the Archival Repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This slide shows a collage of images from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.paradisec.org.au/&quot;&gt;PARADISEC&lt;/a&gt; catalogue and some images of the materials that have been digitised. Objects in the collection range from manuscript images to dynamic media, predominantly audio from analog tapes which are now at risk of loss due to old age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PARADISEC’s separation of data-at-rest from portal application was one of the main inspirations for our implementation protocols, introduced below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opening Australia’s Multilingual Archive is a collection of linked documents, authors and places which was created in Heurist, a legacy digital humanities web app - we used it as a proof-of-concept for getting the objects and their relationships crosswalked from Heurist’s native XML format to an RO-Crate, giving us a file-based archive of the collection. We then extended the LDaCA data discovery portal to include maps and timelines. This gives the sort of rich, immersive data exploration typical of custom websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work we are presenting here builds on “Arkisto”, an initiative started in 2019 and funded by an ARDC precursor, the Australian National Data Service. Arkisto was an &lt;em&gt;informal&lt;/em&gt; collaboration between the University of Technology Sydney and PARADISEC with contributions from AARNet and the State Library of NSW, and resulted in a website that articulated some principles and use cases for designing sustainable repositories. The initial work was presented at OR 2021.
The Arkisto approach is summarised on the home page:
Data on an Arkisto deployment is always available on disc (or object storage) with a complete description independently of any services such as websites or APIs. Once the data is safe and well described, Arkisto has a flexible model for how data can be accessed using a variety of services.
The approach, and the standards it mentioned, the Oxford Common File Layout (OCFL) (Hankinson et al., 2019) and Research Object RO-Crate (RO-Crate) (Soiland-Reyes et al., 2022), were included in the successful proposal for the Language Data Commons of Australia project, and that project with continued collaboration with PARADISEC and the University of Sydney, has advanced the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof=&quot;http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2024/06/04/open-repositories-2024-pilars/Slide09.png&quot; alt=&quot; ::  ::  ::  ::  :: Not really a platform, the core idea was a set of principles :: These are two important specifications but we should not have tied Arkisto to just these two :: THIS BIT IS WHAT WE *REALLY* MEANT TO SAY :: &quot; title=&quot;Slide: 9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arkisto work was helpful in that it aided in securing funding and was the starting point for principled development of Archival Repository solutions. However, it had a few issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core idea of Arkisto was indeed a set of principles, but:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also presented it as a “Platform” (whatever that is) and tied implementation of the platform to two particular Specifications (which we still use at LDaCA).
The informality of the collaboration became a problem when there were disagreements; the site did not have clear ownership or governance so there was no mechanism for resolving issues or making major changes to the site.
We decided to revisit the Arkisto approach, separating out principles (CARE and FAIR), implementation protocols, and then implementation details such as which specifications are followed and software tools to implement them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we introduce the PILARS protocols, which the lead of the LDaCA project, Professor Michael Haugh, described as a guide to implementing “CAREul FAIRness”, referring to the CARE and FAIR principles.
This is a snapshot of the current draft. The Protocols have a persistent identifier: &lt;a href=&quot;http://w3id.org/ldac/pilars&quot;&gt;http://w3id.org/ldac/pilars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gida-global.org/care&quot;&gt;CARE&lt;/a&gt; principles frame the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618&quot;&gt;FAIR&lt;/a&gt; principles with an emphasis on the rights of Indigenous Peoples, and (we think on the LDaCA project) have relevance to any data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current movement toward open data and open science does not fully engage with Indigenous Peoples&#39; rights and interests. Existing principles within the open data movement (e.g. FAIR: findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) primarily focus on characteristics of data that will facilitate increased data sharing among entities while ignoring power differentials and historical contexts. The emphasis on greater data sharing alone creates a tension for Indigenous Peoples who are also asserting greater control over the application and use of Indigenous data and Indigenous Knowledge for collective benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting up the governance is still in progress, but we will be formalising this drawing on the expertise of Robert McLellan - one of the authors of this presentation. The current plan is to use a variant of GitHub’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/github/MVG&quot;&gt;Minimum Viable Governance model&lt;/a&gt; which explains how to create a consensus-based governance system with a management committee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will now introduce the three main PILARS protocols one by one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Data is Portable: assets are not locked in to a particular mode of storage, interface or service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.1 Keep data in one or more general-purpose commodity IT storage systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.1.1 The storage system has a method to store and retrieve file-like datastreams using hierarchical file-paths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.1.2 The storage system has a method to list all the file-paths in the storage system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.2 Divide up data files into [Storage Objects] that form meaningful units, of the smallest practical size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.2.1 Each Storage Object is a directory (or storage object equivalent) containing the files, including metadata and administrative files such as checksums that make up an Object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.2.2 Storage Objects can be located by inspecting the contents of the storage hierarchy by listing the paths (1.1.2), for example by the presence of a file with a defined name in the hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.3 Document and implement an ID resolution mapping system to map IDs to storage locations FAIR-F1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.4. Store documentation about the conventions and standards such as (1.3) used in a data store within the root of the storage service itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.5 Data storage of well-described data objects is considered separately from the current uses to which the data is put.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.6 Data files use open or standard formats where possible, independent of particular software FAIR-I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.7 If data resides in systems, such as content management systems or database applications which do not inherently support all of the protocols 1 &amp;amp; 2 then put processes in place to export data to a system that does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2024/06/04/open-repositories-2024-pilars/Slide15.png&quot; alt=&quot;2  Data is Annotated: contents, structure, provenance and access and reuse permissions are comprehensively described with metadata and licenses ::  :: (TLDR; Use RO-Crate) :: &quot; title=&quot;Slide: 15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 Data is Annotated: contents, structure, provenance and access and reuse permissions are comprehensively described with metadata and licenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.1 For each Storage Object, store metadata that describes (annotates) the object and (optionally) the files that make up the object. The metadata should be stored in a file or files with the data files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.2 For Protocol 2.1 use interoperable general-purpose linked-data metadata stored in a file format which has an Open Specification. This may be extended with domain-specific or ad hoc metadata (which may be in non-linked-data formats) and may be stored in additional files (FAIR-F1 FAIR-F2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.3 For each Storage Object, include at least one license document linked from the metadata using the appropriate property for a ‘license’ from the core vocabulary (e.g. http://schema.org/license), setting out in plain language how data may be used and/or redistributed and by whom (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gida-global.org/care&quot;&gt;CARE&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; [FAIR-R1.1]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.3.1 Do not expose data, for example via a portal without access controls or disseminate confidential license or other governance information. Licensing may change, be withdrawn and new licenses added over time, note, however once data has been distributed under an Open Access license it may not be withdrawn from those who have downloaded it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.3.2 Documentation about licenses for deposit and archive-wide accession policies may also be stored with an object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.4 Store checksum-metadata in a documented standard format alongside data files to help ensure data integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.5 Represent Repository Collections such as archival series or other organising entities as Storage Objects; either self-contained with their member data within the Storage Object or as metadata-only Storage Objects referencing or referenced by other Storage Objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2024/06/04/open-repositories-2024-pilars/Slide16.png&quot; alt=&quot;3 Governance  :: (No shortcuts here – this is the hard part) ::  :: &quot; title=&quot;Slide: 16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Governance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.1 The purpose of the Archival Repository holding the data is articulated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.2 Management systems are in place to sustain the Archival Repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.3 Deposit agreements are in place and documented setting out the rights needed for the Archival Repository as an organisation to manage data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.3 Processes are in place to ensure data persistence for the defined periods that meet the repository purpose (including indefinitely).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.4 Processes are in place for disposal/deaccessioning if appropriate to the purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first two Protocols are about data storage and description and are the core of the PILARS approach to implementation - the third is a recognition that they need to be followed in a governance context. Archival Repositories are not just software packages or application deployments; they need to be seen as social institutions that have the means to persist, and have management and contingency planning in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2024/06/04/open-repositories-2024-pilars/Slide17.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Slide: 17&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial work on establishing Archival Repository infrastructure for the Language Data Commons of Australia focussed on re-housing existing data sets which were in a variety of legacy web applications, with data and metadata locked up in the likes of WordPress and Zope websites. The best of these applications from a migration perspective was the data from Alveo (Burnham et al., 2014); this was available in a Fedora-based repository which was only intermittently available due to support issues and more usefully, a copy of the data stored on disk with linked-data metadata files (N-Triples) allowed us to migrate those collections to the Arkisto standards-stack by cross walking files directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experience with the Alveo collections, including the largest collection, Austalk (Estival et al., 2014), which had data from around 1000 speakers, totalled 60GB (for metadata and audio) with circa 8 million files, was that having data available on disk with adjacent metadata, free from an API was extremely valuable. We had to develop tooling to migrate data but this was much more straightforward because of the use of standards with available software implementations both in source and target, and the ability to have direct access to the data and metadata from storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, the team has been working with other legacy and contemporary research data, most of which has never been archived and does not have standardised metadata. Typically researchers manage this kind of data by keeping it on disk, often with an ad-hoc spreadsheet for metadata. This approach is common to many disciplines; we have dubbed this the “R-Drive” approach, where researchers use local storage, or an institutional research data store (hence the “R”). The following is a simplified workflow infographic developed to assist in communicating the basic principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above diagram shows the current state of known PILARS implementation as of the middle of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three main open-source toolkits at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Language-Research-Technology/oni-ui&quot;&gt;Oni&lt;/a&gt; is an open-source portal application for building data portals from RO-Crate data – (we showed screenshots above; most of them look like shopping websites for data) – but Oni sites are extremely flexible in how they are presented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Language Data Commons of Australia (LDaCA)’ s main deployment is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://data.ldaca.edu.au&quot;&gt;LDaCA data portal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The University of Technology Sydney uses an earlier version of Oni, and is currently being updated to use the LDaCA version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nyingarn.net/&quot;&gt;Nyingarn&lt;/a&gt; makes manuscript sources of Australian Indigenous languages available as searchable and reusable text documents to support language revitalisation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We showed screenshots for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://omaa-arts.sydney.edu.au/&quot;&gt;OMAA&lt;/a&gt; above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we are dealing with resources created by people, with inherent rights in what they say and perform, the RRKive approach has a baked-in expectation that &lt;em&gt;access control&lt;/em&gt; will be needed, in order to respect ICIP, moral rights and legal and ethical constraints imposed by research institutions and “the law of the land” (although within the so-called Australian context, lands were never ceded by the original long-term custodians, and still today, no legitimate legal instrument, or agreement exists to suggest otherwise) we need to provide mechanisms for authorised data access which is why we engage the above mentioned Indigenous Data Sovereignty principles. And it cannot be emphasised enough that implementing a license-based access system is the easy part of this, it is the engagement with rights-holders which can take a lot of time and effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LDaCA has implemented a distributed access control system – we have presented on this before, so will not include that here, see this &lt;a href=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2024/06/04/fair-care-eresearch-2022/&quot;&gt;previous presentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both PARADISEC and Nyingarn at this stage use ‘traditional’ access control lists which are local to the applications themselves, but there is some scope to discuss the adoption of a more decentralised approach if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Language Data Commons of Australia (LDaCA) has extensive materials for partners bringing data to the project about how to work our data licensing issues, obtain a DOI, prepare data for ingest and source long-term storage, remembering that LDaCA is a project and cannot provide perennity for data.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Open Repositories 2023: Trip report
</title>
    <link href="https://ptsefton.com/2023/06/29/report-or-2023/" />
    <updated>2023-06-29T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://ptsefton.com/2023/06/29/report-or-2023/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a summary of my trip to the 18th Open Repositories conference, hosted by Stellenbosch University in South Africa. My travel was paid for by my main employer, the University of Queensland. I&#39;ve attended 17 of the 18 OR conferences -- including the first one which was held in Sydney, organized by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/6614&quot;&gt;Australian Partnership for Sustainable Repositories&lt;/a&gt;. I think &lt;a href=&quot;https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4346-1416&quot;&gt;Jon Dunn&lt;/a&gt; from Indiana and I are now tied at 17 attendances each, not sure if there are any other contenders?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2023/06/29/report-or-2023/image-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;A view of (I think) The Strand, from the conference hotel&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An early morning view from the conference hotel of what I think is the seaside suburb &amp;quot;The strand&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This conference went by really fast -- I was presenting in three sessions, on &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:8001/2023/06/13/ro-crate-or-2023/index.html&quot;&gt;RO-Crate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2023/06/14/arkisto-stack-or-2023/&quot;&gt;A description of the Arkisto repository stack&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:8001/2023/06/13/oni-dev-track-or-2023/index.html&quot;&gt;tech-stream talk on building an ad-hoc repository&lt;/a&gt; (not a live demo, but featuring screen recordings I made on the 14 hour plane ride to Johanesburg that took me 8 hours into the past), chaired a session (more on that below), fell into a jet-lag-coma in my room for one session, and by the time I&#39;d done all that there was not a huge amount of choice left in what to attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;what&#39;s new in repositories&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chaired a session, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.conftool.net/or2023/index.php?page=browseSessions&amp;amp;form_session=511&amp;amp;presentations=show&quot;&gt;Updates on technology platforms&lt;/a&gt;, which had coverage of only two major platforms (DSpace and Islandora) or three if you count DSPace CRIS (which adds features for tracking research metrics) as a separate thing from DSpace, I heard about Dataverse, Invenio in other sessions, but didn&#39;t manage to see anything on EPrints.  My general impression from this was wow - these things have gotten big and complicated, and there are a lot of &lt;em&gt;features&lt;/em&gt; these days. Overall, architectures have matured so the software stacks now tend to have APIs, but they tend to remain fairly monolithic (just an impresson, maybe I&#39;m wrong).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example of what I mean by of lots of features; DSPace CRIS is a layering of a &amp;quot;Current Research Information System&amp;quot; onto the repository platform. We did the same thing with &lt;a href=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2018/07/06/RedBoX-Provisioner-OR2018/index.html&quot;&gt;RedBox&lt;/a&gt; - it started as a repository platform and then after the funding organization in its wisdom had killed off the idea of it actually being a repository it became a metadata registry + data management plans + provisioning of services. What we ended up with was a very complicated system built on a repository-focussed platform that in hindsight would have been better built in a standard web application platform. It&#39;s still valuable, but last time I checked it could do with a rewrite, maybe in Salesforce? No, I&#39;m kidding not that. I&#39;m not sure, but I suspect DSpace CRIS may be like that - building lots of extra functionality into a core application certainly does complicate how you keep it up to date with the main-line application at any rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairing has never been my favourite part of a conference, but I kept everybody to time -- I was grinding my teeth at presenters (often with something to sell) in this and other sessions (no names) who had super-slick slides with a pretty high marketing content, including stuff like the history of their thing, laced with cute cultural references. Fine, but don&#39;t be asking the chair for more time if your presentation is half filler that seemed funny back in the office. Speaking of cultural references, did I mention that some of the &#39;featuritis&#39; that makes these things expensive to deploy and manage reminded me of that time Homer put all those gadgets in his car:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Highlight&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highlight of the conference for me was the the closing keynote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our closing keynote speaker is Prof Hussein Suleman whose research is situated within the Digital Libraries Laboratory in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Cape Town. This session promises to inspire and challenge our participants - to encourage them to think broadly about the ways repositories enable discoverability and interoperability of information and data within the structured web of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prof Suleman&#39;s (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.husseinsspace.com/&quot;&gt;home page&lt;/a&gt; talk, &lt;a href=&quot;https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4196-1444&quot;&gt;ORCiD&lt;/a&gt;)  was indeed challenging the OR status quo: he questioned the complexity of current repositories (see above for my comments on the same), bemoaned the incursion of proprietary software into institutions, pushing aside a movement that has its roots firmly in open source. Like I mentioned above some stuff in the repositories world has drifted pretty far from the original mission of keeping stuff safe and making sure people can find and use it. Anyway regarding resourcing, Suleman said he doesn&#39;t like the the label &amp;quot;The Global South&amp;quot; and prefers to talk about low-resource environments. He noted that much of what he&#39;d heard at the conference -- which he actually attended -- was not relevant to those working in these environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suleman pointed out that while resourcing is of course about money there are several dimensions; he mentioned that in rural areas all over the world various resources are in short supply (money, people, skills, network etc), as well poor organizations such as some NGOs. All of this of course resonates with experiences of colleagues working with language data, or anything really in parts of Australia and the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also identified a huge resource problem, which is that archive projects are often funded for build but not maintenance (this is not just archive projects - even for rich countries like Australia we see funding for building-but-not-maintaining), which has lead Suleman and his colleagues to investigate technologies that are resilient to funding-failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2023/06/29/report-or-2023/image-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;The edge of what I think is called an &amp;quot;informal settlement&amp;quot; near the road to Cape Town&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Speaking of &amp;quot;low resource&amp;quot;, not far from the conference hotel are very different accommodations than shining towers at The Strand. Someone told me there are about 500,000 people living in this part of Cape Town&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suleman works on systems such as the &amp;quot;Simple Archives Project&amp;quot; that demonstrate techniques for preserving archives in low-resource environments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital library systems are not always successfully implemented and sustainable in low resource environments, such as in poor countries and in organisations without resources. As a result, some archives with important collections are short-lived while others never materialise. This paper presents a new toolkit for the creation of simple digital libraries, based on a long trajectory of research into architectural styles. It is hoped that this system and approach will lower the barrier for the creation of digital libraries and provide an alternative architecture for experiments and the exploration of new design ideas. &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.cs.uct.ac.za/id/eprint/1512/&quot;&gt;https://pubs.cs.uct.ac.za/id/eprint/1512/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This uses CSV (the Killer app, says prof Suleman) for metadata, which is transformed into XML and then to a static website - taking this approach should guarantee that things are a little more easily sustainable than repeatedly having to migrate to the latest and greatest DSpace. (I &lt;a href=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2023/06/13/oni-dev-track-or-2023/&quot;&gt;showed our approach to this&lt;/a&gt; in the tech stream).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had noted a couple of things I heard in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.conftool.net/or2023/index.php?page=browseSessions&amp;amp;form_session=509#paperID200&quot;&gt;session on accessing research data&lt;/a&gt;  that are relevant to Suelman&#39;s message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a really great presentation &amp;quot;Rethinking the A in FAIR Data: issues of data access and accessibility in research&amp;quot; in the that looked at just how accessible supposedly universally accessible resources really are, by testing network access to repositories from different regions, from some countries you get to see nothing at all - here&#39;s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frma.2022.912456/full&quot;&gt;link to another full text paper by the same authors&lt;/a&gt; (I have linked to a full version of this which ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reply to a a question about impact after the presentation &amp;quot;Repositioning Repositories: Designing and Assessing the Life Cycle of Research Infrastructures&amp;quot; the presenter (I think it was Ron Dekker speaking) noted that when the UK introduced Hybrid Open Access to publishing, publishers used this as an opportunity to increase their profits -- it didn&#39;t result in better OA or lower costs as planned by the policy makers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reflections on the keynote in the context of our work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, Suleman&#39;s presentation was spot on and I agreed with his main themes, but I did have a couple of issues to discuss, relating what he said back to our work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don&#39;t think XML is currently the best way to represent metadata for preservation&lt;/strong&gt;, or even as part of an ephemeral toolchain, I think it&#39;s better to use JSON-LD (but I would say that, as I&#39;m the co-editor of a the RO-Crate spec which does just that). RO-Crate is much more friendly to 2020s programmers, is more easily extensible and is absolutely aligned with the idea of having static repositories in that it encourages the use of HTML previews for data objects so they can be understood &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; additional software. RO-Crate has standard tools for this and more are in the pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if RO-Crate/JSON-LD is too complicated (and I have to admit, the latest spec is getting that way) then &lt;a href=&quot;https://frictionlessdata.io/&quot;&gt;Frictionless Data&lt;/a&gt; is a JSON-only approach that is simpler to implement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, thinking about XML for metadata I was reminded of a comment made by Ron Ward at USQ many years ago when he encountered the use of XML for metadata. He remarked that in this role (and other data interchange scenarios) XML is not acting as a markup language at all. A Markup language, like HTML - THE Hypertext Markup Language, is something that adds semantic and/or formatting information to textual data which is a very different task from representing hierarchical data structures in the way JSON does. XML&#39;s Markup-focussed heritage means that it is MUCH more complicated to use even for simple metadata schemas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One XML-based protocol that Suleman mentioned was the venerable &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openarchives.org/pmh/&quot;&gt;OAI-PMH&lt;/a&gt;, which he was invovled in creating around the turn of this century. OAI-PMH is a way for repositories to be harvested so their resources can be centrally indexed for discovery. He made a comment that it had stood the test of time, and considered it to be one of those things that could be implemented by a competent developer in a day. I&#39;d have to say that I think that&#39;s overly optomistic, just using existing OAI-PMH software, with all the complexities of sending differently flavoured XML over the wire used to consume a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of developer and support time when I was involved in running a repository support service at the University of Southern Queensland. (Maybe the reason we had trouble was the implementations we used were built in a day? 🤣).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suleman referenced current work on static repositories, with a few totally justified  &amp;quot;what took you so long?&amp;quot; jibes. In particular he name-checked the Oxford Common File Layout (OCFL) (which we use in our current projects) saying that &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; it&#39;s too complicated.  Maybe it is, and we&#39;ve had these discussions in the LDaCA project and with people in our partner project PARADISEC, but our current thinking is that while the OCFL file structure is not exactly human friendly its other preservation features make it an OK trade off. And it&#39;s not that hard to implement. For example with Mike Lynch and Moises Sacal Bonequi at UTS we got a minimal OCFL library going in not much more than a day&#39;s work, and I believe John Ferlito at PARADISEC has had a similar experience adding S3 support this year -- it&#39;s days, not months of work to write a library that can be used for a project. (Writing a more mature, more fully featured library is a lot more work, but will benefit a lot more projects).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as with the comment I made about RO-Crate above, if you&#39;re working in a resource-constrained environment where OCFL is considered too complicated then data can of course simply be placed in a directory/folder in a storage system a la Suleman&#39;s Simple Archives -- this is the approach that the PARADISEC team take when they take portions of the the PARADISEC repository on Raspberry PI based servers to various the Pacific Islands where people can use the repositories from their phones (or whatever devices) on hyper-local networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary &amp;amp; follow-up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary I think Suleman&#39;s talk was a really great articulation of many of the issues in repository practice; I think he made his points very powerfully, inluding a couple of comments that may have made a conference sponsor or two grimace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to Suleman&#39;s challenges I&#39;d like to propose a stream of work at next year&#39;s Open Repositories conference in Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about we hold a pre-conference hands-on workshop that challenges repository developers to embrace some of the approaches Suleman is talking about -- storing files on disk, zero-install indices of content etc? How simple could you go to radically re-imagine a repo stack?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d like to see a mixture of institutional and commercial developers get involved, and to step out of their big fully-featured repository palaces and see what we can get done in a few days over the conference. We&#39;d then have a session at the end of the conference that builds on work by Suleman and others on low-resource-ready repository and archive solutions. There might be token prizes as there are for poster presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;That thing where you go to a conference to meet someone from up the road&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were two people from Australian institutions at the conference. Me obviously, and the other one was Janet McDougall from the Australian Data Archive and the Australian National University. She was presenting in a session on Indigenous Knowledge Preservation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Australian Data Archive (ADA) and Australian National University (ANU) and The Dataverse Project, TKLabels use case&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janet McDougall &amp;amp; Steven McEachern (Australian Data Archive, Australia), Sonia Maria Barbosa (Harvard University, United&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TK and BC Labels are an initiative for Indigenous communities and local organizations. Developed through sustained partnership and testing within Indigenous communities across multiple countries, the Labels allow communities to express local and specific conditions for sharing and engaging in future research and relationships in ways that are consistent with already existing community rules, governance, and protocols for using, sharing and circulating knowledge and data.
ADA has an interest in establishing the means for providing suitable representation of indigenous knowledge within the Dataverse software. This includes functionality in Dataverse to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;link to and incorporate identified sources for indigenous knowledge representation, such as TKLabels and Notices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;curation processes for managing the creation, reading, updating, and deleting of metadata&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;present curated metadata (e.g., TKLabels and TKNotices) in catalogue records&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;allow external aggregators to harvest this metadata (specifically the IDN Data Catalogue, but a preferably standardized model that allows for multiple external parties to harvest)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a workshop next week in Brisbane for the Australian HASS and Indigenous Research Data Commons project(s)  at which Janet will be presenting this work and I will be presenting the LDaCA data access and authorization model, where we look to share implementation experience between projects -- more on that soon. We&#39;re interested in how to translate labels that &amp;quot;express conditions&amp;quot; can be incorporated into environments that authorize access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a global scale Janet and I are near neighbours, but we only seem to get to talk in Montana, or the Kirstenbosch botanic gardens, where outgoing conference chair Claire Knowles and I accompanied Janet for a post-conference volunteer-led botanical tour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2023/06/29/report-or-2023/image-6.png&quot; alt=&quot;A woman holding onto a live flower&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our super-informative volunteer guide (didn&#39;t catch her name) explaining something about a strelitzia (she said you have to understand the empire builder Cecil Rhodes as a man of his time, and after all he did give Cape Town this botanic garden)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;South Africa&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few pics fragments from the trip. I had a few days of personal time (in accordance with the strict UQ policy on these matters).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2023/06/29/report-or-2023/image-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;A cheetah on a leash with his handler&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;s&gt;Tigers&lt;/s&gt;Cheetahs on a &lt;s&gt;gold&lt;/s&gt; leash - good thing I packed the 75-300mm MFT lens for this suburban safari&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not far from the conference, ten minutes by the ubiquitous Toyota Corolla Uber, in a gated community is a Cheetah &#39;sanctuary&#39; where you can pat Cheetah &#39;ambassadors&#39; and gawk at few other animals through the wire. This apparently has something to do with conservation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2023/06/29/report-or-2023/image.png&quot; alt=&quot;Alt text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A little bushwalk (boschwalk?) around Kirstenbosch - clouds on Table Mountain again&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also this happened:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2023/06/29/report-or-2023/image-5.png&quot; alt=&quot;Tweet about a singalong&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5754-9940&quot;&gt;Kim Shepherd&lt;/a&gt; and I were quietly jamming on our ukes in the hotel lobby after the conference dinner when &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pedroprincipe&quot;&gt;Pedro Principe&lt;/a&gt; turned up -- Pedro got the party started on Kim&#39;s uke and I tried to keep up. Kim did percussion on a wine bottle he&#39;d rescued from the dinner. We were mentioned in dispatches, incoming conference chair Torsten Reimer put out a call in the closing remarks for small instruments to be brought to &lt;a href=&quot;https://or2024.openrepositories.org/&quot;&gt;Gothenburg next year&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of conference chairs here&#39;s me and my conference besties, Kim and outgoing chair &lt;a href=&quot;https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6969-7382&quot;&gt;Claire Knowles&lt;/a&gt; about to ascend via cable car into the Table Mountain cloud. View was OK at the bottom station and the top reminded me of home in Katoomba at 1000m above sea level on a misty day, some nice wet rocks and shrubs were on view. Also a youth group running about purposefully with a couple of cheerful leaders, possibly channeling the spirit of Baden-Powell. Anyway they were totally lost; we were thinking of following them to safety when they ran back from the direction  opposite to the one in which they&#39;d departed and asked us the way to somewhere or other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2023/06/29/report-or-2023/image-7.png&quot; alt=&quot;Me, Kim and Claire above Cape Town&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talked about the complexity of the current crop of repository systems, and how to use more distributed, less monolithic designs; Claire&#39;s planning something big but confidential for now (possibly with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/wellcomecollection&quot;&gt;similar design to this&lt;/a&gt;), and Kim&#39;s been working with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.knowledge-basket.co.nz/&quot;&gt;regional archive&lt;/a&gt;  that uses quite simple underlying tech somewhat reminiscent of the approaches advocated by Suleman in his keynote (though we were yet to hear that).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some penguins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2023/06/29/report-or-2023/image-8.png&quot; alt=&quot;African Penguins on a rock&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I did a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bokaapcookingtour.co.za/&quot;&gt;Cape Malay cooking class/tour&lt;/a&gt; of the Bo-Kaap neighbourhood with Zayed and family. Highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2023/06/29/report-or-2023/image-9.png&quot; alt=&quot;Me flipping a roti while Zayed cheers me on&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This presentation was delivered by Peter Sefton at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://or2023.openrepositories.org/&quot;&gt;Open Repositories 2023&lt;/a&gt; conference in South Africa on 2023-06-14 in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.conftool.net/or2023/index.php?page=browseSessions&amp;amp;form_session=460&amp;amp;presentations=show&quot;&gt;Presentations: Discipline specific systems with FAIR principles

&lt;p&gt;We will present a standards-based generalized architecture for large-scale data* repositories for research and preservation illustrated with real world examples drawn from a number of languages and cultural archive projects. This work is taking place in the context of the Australian Humanities and Social Sciences Research Data Commons, particularly the Language Data component thereof and the long-established PARADISEC cultural archive. The standards used include the Oxford Common File Layout for storage, Research Object CRATE (RO-Crate) for consistent linked-data description of FAIR digital objects, and a language data metadata profile to ensure long-term interoperability between systems and re-usability over time. We also discuss data licensing and authorization for access to non-open resources. We suggest that the approach shown here may be used in other disciplines or for other kinds of digital library, repository or archival systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Language Data Commons of Australia Data Partnerships (LDaCA) and the Australian Text Analytics Platform (ATAP) are building towards a scalable and flexible language data and analytics commons. These projects will be part of the HASS (Humanities and Social Sciences) and Indigenous Research Data Commons (HASS+I RDC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Data Commons will focus on preservation and discovery of distributed multi-modal language data collections under a variety of governance frameworks. This will include access control that reflects ethical constraints and intellectual property rights, including those of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander, migrant and Pacific communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The platform will provide workbench services to support computational research, starting with code-notebooks with no-code research tools provided in later phases. Research artifacts such as code and derived data will be made available as fully documented research objects that are re-runnable and rigorously described. Metrics to demonstrate the impact of the platform are projected to include usage statistics, data and article citations. These projects are led by Professor Michael Haugh of the School of Languages and Cultures at the University of Queensland with several partner institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would like to acknowledge the traditional custodians of the lands on which we live and work and the importance of indigenous knowledge, culture and language to the these projects. Peter Sefton lives and works on Wiradjuri land, and for Nick Thieberger and Simon Musgrave it&#39;s the land of the Kulin nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2023/06/14/arkisto-stack-or-2023/Slide03.png&quot; alt=&quot;Pacific and Regional Archive for Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures (PARADISEC) Established 2003 Researchers concerned to digitise, preserve, and make accessible recordings in the many languages of the region around Australia No other agency taking responsibility for these recordings so they were at risk of loss Catalog exposes the existence of these recordings, 38,000 items in 690 collections Currently represent 1,350 languages, in 205 terabytes, with over 16,000 hours of audio recordings, 3,000 hours of video &quot; title=&quot;Slide: 3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PARADISEC is an online archive of cultural data which has been maintained for twenty years, in this presentation we will look at some of the lessons learned from PARADISEC. In summary – the PARADISEC approach to simple data and metadata storage is something we want to continue in LDaCA, while the high cost for PARADISEC of commissioning and maintaining its own software stack is something we want to address by taking a more standards-based approach to managing language and other data over the coming decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2023/06/14/arkisto-stack-or-2023/Slide04.png&quot; alt=&quot;  &quot; title=&quot;Slide: 4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arkisto platform started in 2019 as a way to capture the lessons of PARADISEC and other projects such as Alveo (another language data project similar in scope to LDaCA) which was presented at OR 2014: Sefton PM, Estival D, Cassidy S, Burnham D, Berghold J. The Human Communication Science Virtual Lab (HCS vLab): A repository microclimate in a rapidly evolving research-ecosystem. In: Open Repositories 2014. Helsinki; 2014 [cited 2016 Jul 19].

&lt;p&gt;This diagram was used in the bid documents that established LDaCA - it shows the progression of data from end-of life projects and active repositories into a standards-based data-commons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the data triage process we have been going through in LDaCA — and it should be noted that of all the data we are presented with, most of it needs to be reworked into the Arkisto Standards Stack. Even PARADISEC which in 2019 received the international &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coretrustseal.org/why-certification/certified-repositories/&quot;&gt;Core Trust Seal&lt;/a&gt; based on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.coretrustseal.org/requirements/&quot;&gt;DSA-WDS Core Trustworthy Data Repositories Requirements&lt;/a&gt; is still in the process of migrating data to more sustainable formats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a taster of what data looks like in the kids of repositories we are talking about. This site contains harvested metadata about holdings on Australian Indigenous Languages in University of Queensland Libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The LDaCA services we are building use an API to drive the data portals. The API can be used for direct access with appropriate access control – see &lt;a href=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2023/06/14/arkisto-stack-or-2023/posts/fair-care-eresearch-2022&quot;&gt;another eResearch presentation&lt;/a&gt; which explains this in detail. These screenshots show code notebooks running in BinderHub on the Nectar cloud accessing language resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This  work has also been &lt;a href=&quot;https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc2114304/&quot;&gt;written up&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;em&gt;2nd International Workshop on Digital Language Archives (LangArc 2023) virtual workshop on digital language archives&lt;/em&gt; 2023-06-30.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the overall architecture for data storage and delivery — missing is how data gets into to the repository, but we’ll come to that later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I will introduce one of the themes of this talk. In March this year, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bibwild.wordpress.com/2023/03/21/ocfl-and-source-of-truth-two-options/&quot;&gt;this blog post was published&lt;/a&gt; - looking at the pros and cons of using OCFL (the Oxford Common File Layout) as the “source of truth” for a system (say a repository).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are very much taking the OCFL (that is file-in-storage-as-the-source-of-truth) approach in LDaCA. Which begs the question: “But doesn’t that mean that it’s very specific to language data?” No, because we’re using a very flexible, extensible, discipline-neutral format for data description – yes, we have ways to specialise metadata and interfaces to language and other cultural metadata, but NO, the systems are not locked-in to that mode of operation. This means we should be able to share development and maintenance more broadly than with a single archive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two main points we want to get across in this presentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are taking seriously the idea that data-in-storage should be “batteries included” – everything needed to preserve and use the data is stored together and systems can be reconstituted from this storage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This approach IS generic – different vocabularies / schemas can be plugged-in by design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So lets now start looking at the standards involved in the Arkisto approach. This is a slide from “What is RO-Crate” – The dataset may contain any kind of data resource about anything, in any format as a file or URL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stian Soiland-Reyes, Peter Sefton, Mercè Crosas, Leyla Jael Castro, Frederik Coppens, José M. Fernández, Daniel Garijo, Björn Grüning, Marco La Rosa, Simone Leo, Eoghan Ó Carragáin, Marc Portier, Ana Trisovic, RO-Crate Community, Paul Groth, Carole Goble (2022):Packaging research artefacts with RO-Crate.Data Science 5(2)https://doi.org/10.3233/DS-210053&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2023/06/14/arkisto-stack-or-2023/Slide12.png&quot; alt=&quot;  &quot; title=&quot;Slide: 12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core standard for this work is RO-Crate (Research Object Crate) in which all data is input, stored and output. This a big step for eresearch systems – no longer is there a transformation step on data onboarding (we used the term ingest, but some project members and partners found the metaphor distasteful).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof=&quot;http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2023/06/14/arkisto-stack-or-2023/Slide13.png&quot; alt=&quot;  Here the mechanism is to use the ‘magic’ name METS.xml to store some extra metadata – with a fully linked-data system this kind of thing is not needed &quot; title=&quot;Slide: 13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This screenshot is a bit of (undated) DSpace documentation found following a tip from Kim Sheppard – we have included it here to illustrate that storing additional metadata (in this case METS) for an object was done by convention. Using a linked-data system means that we no longer have to do this kind of thing – there’s still one magic file name in RO-Crate but it’s only one for the metadata and one for the HTML preview – everything else is labelled and extensible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2023/06/14/arkisto-stack-or-2023/Slide14.png&quot; alt=&quot;Using this core layer gives you interoperability with generic tools and general purpose “Who What Where” metadata &quot; title=&quot;Slide: 14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early days of the “Open Repositories” movement repositories had Dublin Core metadata (a standard with a few different flavours).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof=&quot;http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2023/06/14/arkisto-stack-or-2023/Slide15.png&quot; alt=&quot; Using a domain specific profile extends the core RO-Crate for a specific type of data – eg language data, computational workflows or “cultural collections”  (You can use more than one profile) &quot; title=&quot;Slide: 15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days using linked data it is no longer necessary to have a bevy of XML schemas with incompatible encodings to store data from different schemas, different voclabularies and ontologies can co-exist and be expressed in a common way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof=&quot;http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2023/06/14/arkisto-stack-or-2023/Slide16.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Slide: 16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the PARADISEC system this is achieved by storing files on disk in a simple hierarchy - with metadata and other resources stored together in a directory - this scheme allows for hands-on management of data resources, independently of the software used to serve them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach means that if the PARADISEC software-stack becomes un-maintainable for financial or technical reasons the important resources, the data, are stored safely on disk with their metadata and a new access portal could be constructed relatively easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the valuable features of this solution, it is not generalisable. The metadata.xml is custom to PARADISEC, as is the software stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2019 PARADISEC and the eResearch team at UTS received small grants from the Australian National Data Service and began collaborating on an approach to managing archival repositories which built on this PARADISEC approach of storing metadata with data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UTS team presented on this at &lt;a href=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2019/11/05/FAIR%20Repo%20-%20eResearch%20Presentation/index.html&quot;&gt;eResearch Australasia 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2023/06/14/arkisto-stack-or-2023/Slide17.png&quot; alt=&quot;  &quot; title=&quot;Slide: 17&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/structure.html&quot;&gt;structure of an RO-Crate&lt;/a&gt; is very similar to the PARADISEC example above, but with a json file instead of XML, and an optional preview in HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RO-Crate has a growing number of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/tools/&quot;&gt;tools and software libraries&lt;/a&gt; which means that a team such as PARADISEC does not have to maintain their own bespoke software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof=&quot;http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2023/06/14/arkisto-stack-or-2023/Slide18.png&quot; alt=&quot;  &quot; title=&quot;Slide: 18&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, for comparison is &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/FEDORA6x/Fedora+OCFL+Object+Structure#FedoraOCFLObjectStructure-FedoraAtomicResource-Container&quot;&gt;how Fedora 6 would store an object (an Atomic Resource in Fedora-speak) like this with multiple files&lt;/a&gt;. Like RO-Cratee this uses linked-dataa but in this case split up into multiple files containing RDF triples. (This is similar to the pre-RO-Crate approach taken by the Research Object spec).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also shows some of what an OCFL repository looks like – this is an OCFL object with a single version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof=&quot;http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2023/06/14/arkisto-stack-or-2023/Slide19.png&quot; alt=&quot; This is an RO-Crate Object which is stored as an OCFL Object &quot; title=&quot;Slide: 19&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This screenshot shows an example of an Arkisto-style use of OCFL (all of the metadata is stored in the ro-crate-metadata.json rather than spread out as in Fedora).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we come to the second core standard in our stack the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ocfl.io&quot;&gt;Oxford Common File Layout&lt;/a&gt; – which is something we found out about via OpenRepositories – I couldn’t make the presentation, but I got a corridor briefing on this from Neil Jeffries in Bozeman at OR 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This slide shows the interface between our core standards – a compliant OCFL repository has Objects within it that conform to the RO-Crate specification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This slide illustrates the flexibility of the approach we’re taking. As LDaCA is a national project, our archival repositories and those of our partners such as PARADISEC will be distributed with differences of governance, varying by organisation, language type and discipline, though there is still a desire to be able to aggregate data into services that make it findable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The storage services may not all be the same in this model, some may be file systems, some may be object stores, and they may be hosted by and governed by a variety of organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2023/06/14/arkisto-stack-or-2023/Slide24.png&quot; alt=&quot;  &quot; title=&quot;Slide: 24&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This slide shows how we have abstracted the “A” for Access in FAIR out of the repository and into a separate centralised or at least &lt;em&gt;concentrated&lt;/em&gt; system. We have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ldaca.edu.au/posts/fair-care-eresearch-2022/&quot;&gt;full write-up of this approach from the 2022 eResearch Australasia conference&lt;/a&gt; and we don’t have time to go through it in detail here, but in summary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every object in the repository has a Data Reuse License with some management metadata.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each repository only needs an authoritative list of licenses and trusted license management systems to be able to serve the data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;License management is handled by a dedicated system that can deal with application and invitation workflows to grant licenses (including simple self-serve click-through license agreements)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that our work is also informed by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gida-global.org/care&quot;&gt;CARE principles for Indigenous data Governance (Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility, Ethics)&lt;/a&gt; which frame the way FAIR protocols are implemented. Again, see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc2114304/&quot;&gt;LangArc workshop write-up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2023/06/14/arkisto-stack-or-2023/Slide25.png&quot; alt=&quot;  Ok but how does the data get there? &quot; title=&quot;Slide: 25&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s revisit this diagram. What’s missing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first phase of the LDaCA project, work focused on batch import of data using tools to convert collections – this approach was used on contemporary collections as well as for “rescuing” collections from older repository system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof=&quot;http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2023/06/14/arkisto-stack-or-2023/Slide27.png&quot; alt=&quot; {      &amp;quot;@id&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;https://github.com/Language-Research-Technology/corpus-tools-ro-crate&amp;quot;,      &amp;quot;@type&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;SoftwareSourceCode&amp;quot;,      &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;https://github.com/Language-Research-Technology/corpus-tools-ro-crate&amp;quot;,      &amp;quot;description&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Converts an RO-Crate to an LDaCA OCFL collection as long as the crate has repository Objects and Collections that are members of a RepositoryCollection in the root dataset&amp;quot;,      &amp;quot;programmingLanguage&amp;quot;: {        &amp;quot;@id&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js&amp;quot;      }    },    {      &amp;quot;@id&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;#provenance&amp;quot;,      &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Created RO-Crate using corpus-tools-ro-crate&amp;quot;,      &amp;quot;@type&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;CreateAction&amp;quot;,      &amp;quot;instrument&amp;quot;: {        &amp;quot;@id&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;https://github.com/Language-Research-Technology/corpus-tools-ro-crate&amp;quot;      },      &amp;quot;result&amp;quot;: {        &amp;quot;@id&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;ro-crate-metadata.json&amp;quot;      }    } The act of creation of this metadata is documented &quot; title=&quot;Slide: 27&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This slide shows some JSON-LD metadata that describes the way this RO-Crate metadata was created – illustrating how RO-Crate can be used to record provenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(UPDATE: I didn&#39;t explain &lt;a href=&quot;https://json-ld.org/&quot;&gt;JSON-LD&lt;/a&gt; properly during the presentation. JSON-LD is a method of encoding linked-data (which can be quite esoteric and unapproachable) in JSON a method of describing data in simple text, which is widely used and understood by programmers.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we see the Crate-O metadata tool (which is a zero-install web application that runs in Chrome and other browsers that support the new FilesystemAPI) being used to add an Organization as the Affiliation for a Person entity. Having imported this &amp;quot;Context Entity&amp;quot; (that&#39;s the RO-Crate term) it can then be re-used within the crate which we see here as the schema.org &lt;code&gt;publisher&lt;/code&gt; property is linked to the same organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(At this stage Crate-O is still to be connected to the repository stack - that will happen in the second half of 2023)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope to work with other editor projects (eg &lt;a href=&quot;https://describo.github.io/#/&quot;&gt;Describo&lt;/a&gt;) to make editor profiles as compatible as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next series of slides show some examples of our approach implemented in a variety of contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s another repository that uses RO-Crate metadata (from the Language Data Commons of Australia / Australian Text Analytics Platform) – here users can launch a Jupyter notebook containing Python code (and explanatory text) that processes a dataset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This page shows some screenshots of an internal-only application at UTS which gives academic staff access to successful research grant proposals – the data are stored in the same kind of Arkisto standards-based storage stack as we have presented here – with an interface that is tuned for this use case, with some custom access control to make sure that staff are &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; aware that these are sensitive and confidential documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, we have given a quick tour of a standards-based repository stack (loosely called Arkisto) and illustrated it with current work at the Language Data Commons of Australia and PARADISEC projects, but along the way have tried to emphasise that this is generic, re-usable architecture – and is based on standards. By using an extensible metadata standard with a growing community, and a storage-layer standard forged from an acquired aversion to systems migration we aim to reduce the risk to very important cultural data by working with as many communities as possible on software tools, so that we reduce cost and risk for all of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This presentation was delivered by Peter Sefton at Open Repositories 2023: it includes slides adapted from other RO-Crate presentations by Stian Soiland-Reyes and others - but here “I” means is Sefton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research Object Crate (RO-Crate) is a community effort and specification to practically achieve FAIR packaging of research objects (digital objects like data, methods, software) with structured metadata and context. RO-Crate uses well-established Web standards and FAIR principles. For common metadata representations, RO-Crate builds on schema.org, a mature and general mark-up vocabulary used by search engines, including Google Dataset Search. RO-Crate is adopted by many research projects as a pragmatic implementation of the FAIR principles that can be both general for interoperable exchange and extensible for domain-specific archiving.
RO-Crate development began in early 2019, when a workshop at Open Repositories 2019 in Hamburg generated a significant number of use-cases and expressions of interest from the OR community. This presentation will introduce RO-Crate, its continuing development and rapid adoption since 2019, report on how it is now being used in repository software, and the potential for further use in repository platforms that will be familiar to OR attendees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Outline&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation we’ll cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A quick run thru what RO-Crate is and what it is for&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New developments:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Version 1.2 is coming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Profiles are seeing a lot of activity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tooling continues to improve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are our aims:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Describe&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;package&lt;/em&gt; data collections, datasets, software etc. with their &lt;em&gt;metadata&lt;/em&gt; (And remember in the context of Open Repositories: publications are data too)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Platform-independent&lt;/em&gt; object exchange between repositories and services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support &lt;em&gt;reproducibility&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;analysis&lt;/em&gt;: link data with codes and workflows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transfer of &lt;em&gt;sensitive/large&lt;/em&gt; distributed datasets with persistent identifiers&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Propagate &lt;em&gt;provenance&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;existing metadata&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Reuse existing &lt;em&gt;standards&lt;/em&gt;, but hide their complexity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re trying to be fairly platform-independent, and we&#39;re not too tied into a particular way of storing or identifying these components. We do want to have enough information for reproducibility ,and to support data that are coming in from different sources, that may not even be accessible directly because they require authorization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of the Research Object (RO) is to gather data in a kind of virtual package. This may include some actual files, and it may include outgoing references; these are related together and given brief descriptions. That way we know what the data are, and what role they play in &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I presented RO-Crate to a senior research technology leader recently who had not yet heard of RO-Crate – and they stopped me and asked “why is there &lt;em&gt;Research&lt;/em&gt; in the name” – pointing out that RO-Crate is obviously applicable to more thanresearch use cases. The answer lies in the genealogy; RO-Crate is a merger between the Research Object line of work at the University of Manchester and DataCrate from the University of Technology Sydney - the technology is not inherently specific to research – but the motivations, particularly the FAIR principles do come from the the research world.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This slide shows a screenshot of the RO-Crate specification. The spec is designed to be an implementation guide that builds on other standards – we will continue to work on making this as simple as possible for tool developers (we admit parts of it have started to get a bit complex as we take on more use cases).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RO-Crate is now a very healthy community - the spec is developed by an open process with fortnightly calls, and a github repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have regular calls – a “main” monthly call and a Euro-focussed call.  People call in from all over Europe, the US and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;POST Conference note: This is obviously not what you&#39;d call global coverage Claire Knowles pointed out to me the number of people at OR who were standing in Africa talking about their &#39;global&#39; projects which often have low-to-zero represention outside of North America and Europe (we&#39;ll count Australasia as part of that as Australia&#39;s in Eurovision).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a growing body of work on RO-Crate this Zenodo repository captures part of it - but it’s starting to show up in repositories and presentations in a lot of research contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof=&quot;http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2023/06/13/ro-crate-or-2023/Slide09.png&quot; alt=&quot;  &quot; title=&quot;Slide: 9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workflow Hub is a example of a repository (though it calls itself a registry) – it contains scientific workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof=&quot;http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2023/06/13/ro-crate-or-2023/Slide10.png&quot; alt=&quot;  RO-Crate is built-in &quot; title=&quot;Slide: 10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s an example of a workflow in the WorkflowHub registry/repository – there’s a download button to get a workflow in RO-Crate format. Note the ‘sketch’ which illustrates the workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof=&quot;http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2023/06/13/ro-crate-or-2023/Slide11.png&quot; alt=&quot;  There’s an HTML page included in the RO-Crate Download that makes the crate human readable &quot; title=&quot;Slide: 11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you download this workflow crate then you get a preview file like the one shown including the precis &amp;quot;sketch&amp;quot; of the workflow and links to the files – eg the &amp;quot;Main Workflow&amp;quot; link. This shows the benefits of RO-Crate – every download has a machine-readable metadata file, and there&#39;s  a human-readable web page to go with it. If you find this on your computer in 10 year&#39;s time there is information there about what it is, and where it came from in a standardised format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof=&quot;http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2023/06/13/ro-crate-or-2023/Slide12.png&quot; alt=&quot;  RO-Crate Built-in here as well at RO-Hub &quot; title=&quot;Slide: 12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://reliance.rohub.org/fb3a8b1f-7132-4c0e-80c8-33ff294808da?activetab=overview&quot;&gt;item from RO-Hub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EOSC project RELIANCE use RO-Crate to package data cubes of earth observation data, along with documentation, images and workflows&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connects to related infrastructures for interactive execution/analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metadata includes temporal coverage, spatial coverage and vertical coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ROHub publishes the archived RO-Crates to general-purpose repositories (Zenodo, B2Share) for longevity and PIDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The RO-Crate preview file in this service could use work; it’s a raw representation of the JSON metadata but is still better than the old days)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof=&quot;http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2023/06/13/ro-crate-or-2023/Slide13.png&quot; alt=&quot;  &quot; title=&quot;Slide: 13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the above examples we showed how resources can be downloaded from repositories in RO-Crate format – but there are still no widely accepted standard in place to joint the dots between, say a DOI for a dataset and an actual download of that data. DOIs resolve to web pages, not data streams – the RO-Crate community is actively engaged in joining these dots with work on FAIR signposting – establishing protocols for automated signalling of where data can be downloaded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have just seen an example of an ATTACHED crate – you might call it RO-Crate “classic”, this is the starting point for RO-Crate – it’s first use case as a packaging format. In an Attached Crate data resources are included alongside the RO-Crate-metadata.json file. When we introduced RO-Crate at OR2019 in Hamburg this was the ONLY kind of crate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof=&quot;http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2023/06/13/ro-crate-or-2023/Slide15.png&quot; alt=&quot;  &quot; title=&quot;Slide: 15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detached Crates, on the other hand, have resources that are NOT local. For example, an RO-Crate metadata document dowloaded from an API might reference resources available from the API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof=&quot;http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2023/06/13/ro-crate-or-2023/Slide16.png&quot; alt=&quot;  References file streams from the API &quot; title=&quot;Slide: 16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what a “Detached  RO-Crate” looks like over an API – in this case one that is showing a collection of plays in English from the 1500s (this data features in another presentation given at Open Repositories, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2023/06/13/oni-dev-track-or-2023/&quot;&gt;a demonstration&lt;/a&gt; illustrating the technical details of an RO-Crate-based repository architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This diagram sketches the architecture of the ]Australian Text Analytics](https://atap.edu.au), which is part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ldaca.edu.au&quot;&gt;Language Data Commons of Australia&lt;/a&gt; , and shows the integration between data repositories (in green, on the right) and code execution environments (in red, on the left). The integration between these things is via documentation – and standards-based metadata (including, of course, RO-Crate).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof=&quot;http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2023/06/13/ro-crate-or-2023/Slide18.png&quot; alt=&quot;  https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/tools/  &quot; title=&quot;Slide: 18&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been talking about RO-Crate tools – here’s the list from the website. Like any list of tools it can be hard to keep this up to date (like, for example I am talking about the Crate-O tool here but it is not yet on the list). Here’s the RO-Crate tools page: https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/tools/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s another repository that uses RO-Crate metadata (from the Lanaguage Data Commons of Australia / Australian Text Analytics Platform) – users can launch a Jupyter notebook in a binderhub execution environment. The Notebook fetches a Detached RO-Crate metadata document, processes it to filter further resources to fetch, and then fetches them from the API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof=&quot;http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2023/06/13/ro-crate-or-2023/Slide20.png&quot; alt=&quot; SCREENSHOT OF NOTEBOOK  &quot; title=&quot;Slide: 20&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a screenshot of the Notebook, using he python RO-Crate library to consume data from the API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RO-Crate Python library has lots of functionality for doing actual data packaging – it has a file-system interface (we mention this as it is different from the approach taken in the Javascript library).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof=&quot;http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2023/06/13/ro-crate-or-2023/Slide22.png&quot; alt=&quot;  &quot; title=&quot;Slide: 22&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And ro-crate-py has a commandline interface or making RO-Crates step by step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof=&quot;http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2023/06/13/ro-crate-or-2023/Slide23.png&quot; alt=&quot;  &quot; title=&quot;Slide: 23&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RO-Crate-js (Javascript) takes a different approach – it is much more abstract, and has no direct connection to the file system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof=&quot;http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2023/06/13/ro-crate-or-2023/Slide24.png&quot; alt=&quot;  &quot; title=&quot;Slide: 24&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RO-Crate excel creates a crate from a directory of files, and can allow existing ad hoc tabular metadata to be added to RO-Crates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we see the Crate-O metadata tool (which is a zero-install web application that runs in Chrome and other browsers that support the new FilesystemAPI) being used to add an Organization as the Affiliation for a Person entity. Having imported this &amp;quot;Context Entity&amp;quot; (that&#39;s the RO-Crate term) it can then be re-used within the crate which we see here as the schema.org &lt;code&gt;publisher&lt;/code&gt; property is linked to the same organization – with the ROR (Research Organization Registry) identifier https://ror.org/00eae9z71&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Introducing the Oni Repository Stack</title>
    <link href="https://ptsefton.com/2023/06/13/oni-dev-track-or-2023/" />
    <updated>2023-06-13T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://ptsefton.com/2023/06/13/oni-dev-track-or-2023/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;By:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peter Sefton&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moises Sacal Bonequi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alvin Sebastian&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mark Raadgever&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presentation was delivered by Peter Sefton at Open Repositorites 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation we will show some of the general purpose repository tooling used to manage repository data for the Language Data Commons of Australia and the Australian Text Analytics Platform. We have a standards-based repository stack which is used to make research data available for human and machine-use. The main part of the stack is “Oni” https://github.com/Arkisto-Platform/oni which builds an access-controlled REST API from an Oxford Common File Layout (OCFL) data store (which consists of data objects which are saved as files-on-disk or in object storage), with data objects are described using the RO-Crate metadata standard. Data is indexed into a postgres-driven API for low-level access, and a full discovery index implemented in ElasticSearch, with the ability to create access portals in your web framework of choice. We will demonstrate rapid creation of large scale repositories using batch tooling, as well as using a metadata entry tool known as Describo to produce RO-Crate linked-data descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This slide shows the &amp;quot;small pieces, loosely joined style of the Oni repository&amp;quot; -- it is based on an OCFL data store for digital objects on disk or object storage - with RO-Crate metadata for each object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The architecture&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2023/06/13/oni-dev-track-or-2023/oni_diagrams_oni-architecture-2.svg&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This diagram shows the architecture of the Oni system. The name Oni started as an acronym -- Ocfl + NGINX (a web server) + Index (eg Solr or Elastic Search) but we no longer use NGNIX and Oni happens to be a kind of Ogre which has its own emoji 👹.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This demonstration shows and example of how to stand-up a repository for 300 documents, in this case plays in TEI XML format which we got from &lt;a href=&quot;https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9336-1678&quot;&gt;Professor Hugh Craig&lt;/a&gt;. The first steps involve getting the data into an Oxford Common File Layout &lt;a href=&quot;https://ocfl.io&quot;&gt;OCFL&lt;/a&gt; repository with each &amp;quot;object&amp;quot; (a play) in the repository described using Research Object Crate metadata: RO-Crate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Some data – ~300 plays from the 1500s&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2023/06/13/oni-dev-track-or-2023/list-metadata.gif&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This screen recording shows a command line session; listing the contents of a data directory full of XML and peeking into the CSV metadata supplied with the files by Professor Craig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Using RO-Crate-excel, execute a few maneuvers&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2023/06/13/oni-dev-track-or-2023/rocxl.mov.gif&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this recording, we use the RO-Crate Excel tool to generate an Excel workbook listing all the files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Paste in the researcher&#39;s data&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2023/06/13/oni-dev-track-or-2023/sheet-detail.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Excel, we can manipulate data in a transparent way to get it ready for conversion into RO-Crate format -- the RO-Crate Excel tool uses some conventions that mean we can &amp;quot;show our working&amp;quot; in this process, and mark some of the more esoteric metadata as hidden (for now), though it is still available in the researcher&#39;s original ad-hoc CSV format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Fine tune using Crate-O ...&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2023/06/13/oni-dev-track-or-2023/crate-o-org.mov.gif&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we see the Crate-O metadata tool (which is a zero-install web application that runs in Chrome and other browsers that support the new FilesystemAPI) being used to add an Orgnization as the Affiliation for a Person entity. Having imported this &amp;quot;Context Entity&amp;quot; (that&#39;s the RO-Crate term for this type of contextual metadata) it can then be re-used within the crate which we see here as the schema.org &lt;code&gt;publisher&lt;/code&gt; property is linked to the same orgnization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Here&#39;s where you get Crate-O&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2023/06/13/oni-dev-track-or-2023/crate-o-site.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get the Crate-O source or try it out &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Language-Research-Technology/crate-o&quot;&gt;at this github repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;… and you get an RO-Crate for the data&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2023/06/13/oni-dev-track-or-2023/rochtml.mov.gif&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This slide shows generating an HTML preview file that summarizes the data -- the RO-Crate is a JSON-LD file that was created from the spreadsheet shown above, and tweaked using Crate-O. JSON-LD is Linked Data in JSON format, this is what RO-Crate uses to make linked data approachable for a general programming audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Then using corpus-tools-ro-crate, make an OCFL repo&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2023/06/13/oni-dev-track-or-2023/make-plays.mov.gif&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This slide shows another script (via a make file that supplies a set of commandline paramaters) which takes the RO-Crate and &amp;quot;explodes&amp;quot; it into a set of OCFL (Oxford Common File Layout) directories in a &amp;quot;Storage Root&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;This is the OCFL file layout&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2023/06/13/oni-dev-track-or-2023/ocfl-screenshot.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s what an OCFL repository might look like during development -- I built this on the &#39;plane to South Africa, somewhere over the Southen Ocean, and you can see that my tweaks to the code resulted in several versions of the OCFL/RO-Crate objects being created. In this recording I navigate to a file, open the RO-Crate Metadata Document, and inspect the metadata profile that it links to from the &lt;code&gt;conformsTo&lt;/code&gt; property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Start up 👹 and index stuff&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type, like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; docker compose up

 ... Screenfulls of stuff

&amp;gt; node structural-index.js 

{ message: &#39;Started: database indexer&#39; }



&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Et Voila!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2023/06/13/oni-dev-track-or-2023/portal.mov.gif&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a search portal for the plays with an Elastic search for full text for &lt;s&gt;facets&lt;/s&gt; aggregations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, this repository stack is quite different from DSpace, ePrints and other repository systems where everything is built in to one application - the approach is more like the unix&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Tools used here&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This presentation will look at how a Metadata Standard - RO-Crate - with Metadata Profile (the Language Data Commons) is being developed and implemented. Two major collections are collaborating on the standard, PARADISEC and the Language Data Commons of Australia (LDaCA). This ongoing standardisation effort for language data is designed to improve interoperability, reduce costs for data migration and allow storage on disk, object storage or in archival repositories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/&quot;&gt;RO-Crate&lt;/a&gt; is a linked-data metadata system which allows discovery metadata (Who, what where) based on the widely adopted Schema.org vocabulary to be seamlessly integrated with more discipline specific metadata. RO-Crate uses metadata profiles to provide guidance for packaging resources for particular disciplines and purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation we will introduce a RO-Crate metadata profile for language data which extends the core RO-Crate standard with new vocabulary terms adapted from pre-linked-data discipline specific metadata efforts, particularly the Open Language Archives Community (OLAC) standards. The profile has English-language guidance on how to structure collections of resources in a repository with links between them, such that they can be indexed and displayed via APIs and search/browse portals. The profile is also implemented as a series of machine-readable profiles for the Describo Online metadata description system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will demonstrate current ways of describing items in a variety of languages and modes (spoken, written and signed), from a large set of heterogeneous language resources held by PARADISEC and LDaCA. We will also show how to access them via API calls and a search portal, and how resources may be stored in simple storage systems using the Arkisto platform (a set of standards and principles).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Language Data Commons of Australia Data Partnerships (&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.47486/HIR001&quot;&gt;LDaCA&lt;/a&gt;) and the Australian Text Analytics Platform (&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.47486/PL074&quot;&gt;ATAP&lt;/a&gt;) are building towards a scalable and flexible language data and analytics commons. These projects will be part of the Humanities and Social Sciences Research Data Commons (HASS RDC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Data Commons will focus on preservation and discovery of distributed multi-modal language data collections under a variety of governance frameworks. This will include access control that reflects ethical constraints and intellectual property rights, including those of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander, migrant and Pacific communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The platform will provide workbench services to support computational research, starting with code-notebooks with no-code research tools provided in later phases. Research artefacts such as code and derived data will be made available as fully documented research objects that are re-runnable and rigorously described. Metrics to demonstrate the impact of the platform are projected to include usage statistics, data and article citations. These projects are led by Professor Michael Haugh of the School of Languages and Culture at the University of Queensland with several partner institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PARADISEC (the Pacific And Regional Archive for Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures) is a digital archive of records of some of the many small cultures and languages of the world and it has developed models to ensure that the archive can provide access to interested communities while also conforming with emerging international standards for digital archiving. Australian researchers have been making unique and irreplaceable audiovisual recordings in the region since portable field recorders became available in the mid-twentieth century, yet until the establishment of PARADISEC there was no Australian repository for these invaluable research recordings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goal: Be able to store data with an eye on preservation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an archive like PARADISEC - it is important to be be able to maintain resources over the long term. For example, much material which falls within the scope of PARADISEC is stored on legacy media. PARADISEC archives tapes from a range of sources, such as the agencies in the Pacific shown in the images above. Such material needs to be digitised and returned to the source with meaningful metadata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2022/11/25/ldaca-metadata-ecosystem-eresearch-2022/Slide05.png&quot; alt=&quot;PARADISEC ACCESS  https://language-archives.services/about/data-loader &quot; title=&quot;Slide: 5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PARADISEC has learned the importance of making the collection self-describing so it is not dependent on a database as the sole metadata source. It does use a database for administrative services, from which a text file with metadata for any item can be exported. This allows us to select an arbitrary set of items, put them on a hard disk, and use the dataloader application to generate an html catalog of just those items, drawing on the internal metadata file describing each item. This can be delivered on a hard disk to a local community or cultural organisation, or on a raspberry pi wifi local network to allow access on phones, as seen here in Erakor village in central Vanuatu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example of how good metadata practice can improve community access is the Auslan (Australian Sign Language) corpus, for which community access is very important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Auslan Corpus has been stored with the Endangered Languages Archive (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elararchive.org/&quot;&gt;ELAR&lt;/a&gt;) since 2008. However, ELAR does not currently suit the access needs of the Auslan corpus; it has low discoverability, and files must be downloaded individually. The corpus, along with the Auslan SignBank dictionary, is being included in LDaCA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Auslan Corpus holds great value as an educational tool for Auslan users and learners, both Deaf and hearing, and the move to LDaCA will allow further development of educational tools. One such tool is the ability, still under development, for Auslan Signbank dictionary to pull real-world examples of signs out of the corpus to show alongside dictionary entries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all of the collections we are working with data is discoverable via some kind of web portal which indexes and displays the archive (repository) of data. These screenshots are of work in progress at LDaCA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The LDaCA services we are building use an API to drive the data portals. The API can be used for direct access with appropriate access control – see &lt;a href=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2022/11/25/ldaca-metadata-ecosystem-eresearch-2022/posts/fair-care-eresearch-2022&quot;&gt;another eResearch presentation&lt;/a&gt; which explains this in detail. These screenshots show code notebooks (running in BinderHub on the Nectar cloud) accessing language resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2022/11/25/ldaca-metadata-ecosystem-eresearch-2022/Slide09.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Slide: 9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having looked at the user-facing products, websites and APIs, we turn our attention to how data is managed on disk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the PARADISEC system this is achieved by storing files on disk in a simple hierarchy - with metadata and other resources stored together in a directory - this scheme allows for hands-on management of data resources, independently of the software used to serve them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach means that if the PARADISEC software-stack becomes un-maintainable for financial or technical reasons the important resources, the data, are stored safely on disk with their metadata and a new access portal could be constructed relatively easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the valuable features of this solution, it is not generalisable. The metadata.xml is custom to PARADISEC, as is the software stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2019 PARADISEC and the eResearch team at UTS received small grants from the Australian National Data Service and began collaborating on an approach to managing archival repositories which built on this PARADISEC approach of storing metadata with data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UTS team presented on this at &lt;a href=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2019/11/05/FAIR%20Repo%20-%20eResearch%20Presentation/index.html&quot;&gt;eResearch Australasia 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof=&quot;http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2022/11/25/ldaca-metadata-ecosystem-eresearch-2022/Slide10.png&quot; alt=&quot;  &quot; title=&quot;Slide: 10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this Research Data Commons work we are using the Arkisto Platform (introduced &lt;a href=&quot;http://ptsefton.com/2020/11/23/Arkisto/index.html&quot;&gt;at eResearch 2020&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arkisto aims to ensure the long term preservation of data independently of code and services, recognizing the ephemeral nature of software and platforms. We know that sustaining software platforms can be hard and aim to make sure that important data assets are not locked up in databases or hard-coded logic of some hard-to-maintain application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by PARADISEC’s approach the Arkisto platform is based on the idea of storing data in simple easy to manage file or object storage systems with metadata in an easily readable standard format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LDaCA repositories use the Oxford Common File Layout (&lt;a href=&quot;https://ocfl.io/&quot;&gt;OCFL&lt;/a&gt;) standard which is backed and used by a number of universities and has multiple implementations while PARADISEC data will be migrated to a simpler data storage approach &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/CoEDL/nocfl-js&quot;&gt;NOCFL&lt;/a&gt;, which is a single-library implementation, inspired by some of the same aims, but with different implementation choices to avoid data being obfuscated by OCFL’s layout, which is a product of its commitment to immutable, write-once file management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now to the main focus of this presentation - the metadata “Profile” we are jointly developing to ensure that language resources can be described in a way that is interoperable between software, and re-usable over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Profile is an “RO-Crate Profile”, a kind of Cook Book for how to describe and package language data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof=&quot;http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RO-Crate is method for describing a dataset as a digital object using a &lt;strong&gt;single linked-data metadata document&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof=&quot;http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dataset may contain any kind of data resource about anything, in any format as a file or URL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof=&quot;http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2022/11/25/ldaca-metadata-ecosystem-eresearch-2022/Slide14.png&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; title=&quot;Slide: 14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RO-Crate standard also strongly recommends that JSON metadata is supplemented with an HTML preview - above we show what that looks like for a PARADISEC item. This is a screenshot of an HTML view of a PARADISEC Item generated using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/UTS-eResearch/ro-crate-html-js&quot;&gt;an HTML rendering tool for RO-Crate&lt;/a&gt;. The important point here is that this is a &lt;em&gt;generic&lt;/em&gt; viewer that can understand any RO-Crate. It may not be glamorous but it could be included in an archive as a way to provide human-readable access in the absence of portals that are data specific (but cost money to build and maintain).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof=&quot;http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2022/11/25/ldaca-metadata-ecosystem-eresearch-2022/Slide15.png&quot; alt=&quot; https://mod.paradisec.org.au &quot; title=&quot;Slide: 15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the same page from the previous slide seen in a working model of an RO-Crate set exported from the current PARADISEC catalog, with a single page viewer using an elastic search. The two pages shown here are generated directly from metadata that was stored in an RO-Crate in a storage system using PARADISEC specific, rather than generic code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof=&quot;http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2022/11/25/ldaca-metadata-ecosystem-eresearch-2022/Slide16.png&quot; alt=&quot;  &quot; title=&quot;Slide: 16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/structure.html&quot;&gt;structure of an RO-Crate&lt;/a&gt; is very similar to the PARADISEC example above, but with a json file instead of XML, and an optional preview in HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RO-Crate has a growing number of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/tools/&quot;&gt;tools and software libraries&lt;/a&gt; which means that a team such as PARADISEC do not have to maintain their own bespoke software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof=&quot;http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2022/11/25/ldaca-metadata-ecosystem-eresearch-2022/Slide17.png&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; title=&quot;Slide: 17&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The base vocabulary for the JSON-LD used in RO-Crate is schema.org - a widely used linked data standard. RO-Crate uses a handful of terms from other ontologies but importantly it allows for seamless extensibility with domain specific vocabularies, which is what we will talk about next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof=&quot;http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2022/11/25/ldaca-metadata-ecosystem-eresearch-2022/Slide18.png&quot; alt=&quot;  &quot; title=&quot;Slide: 18&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PARADISEC metadata model is based on the Open Language Archives (OLAC) metadata standard. This is an XML based standard, but has good online documentation, which is perfect for migrating to a Linked Data approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used the OLAC terms, including &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.language-archives.org/REC/type-20020628.html&quot;&gt;some that were proposed but withdrawn&lt;/a&gt; as the basis for a new vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of a LIEF project (2022-23, led by author Thieberger), revisions to the OLAC scheme are planned, together with rebuilding the OLAC metadata harvester and aggregator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2022/11/25/ldaca-metadata-ecosystem-eresearch-2022/Slide19.png&quot; alt=&quot;  &quot; title=&quot;Slide: 19&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Langauge Data Terms have been published at &lt;a href=&quot;https://purl.archive.org/language-data-commons/terms&quot;&gt;https://purl.archive.org/language-data-commons/terms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These terms have been modernised and mainstreamed from previous ways of describing resources, for example instead of describing the main item of interest as a PrimaryText (where text is any kind of communicative resource – not a bitstream of characters) we use the term PrimaryResource. And in the example in the image, the type of genre &lt;em&gt;Informational&lt;/em&gt; has been added to the set proposed in the OLAC vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Image prompt DALL-E a hierarchical whale skeleton digital art)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we come back in detail to how RO-Crate works we will discuss the structure or skeleton of our language collections stored in a repository&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof=&quot;http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2022/11/25/ldaca-metadata-ecosystem-eresearch-2022/Slide21.png&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; title=&quot;Slide: 21&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadly speaking there are two ways that an Arkisto-style repository can be structured and the profile sets out criteria for choosing one of the options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For small, stable collections of data an entire collection (often referred to a ‘corpus’ by linguists) can be stored in a single directory or directory-like structure in an object store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof=&quot;http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2022/11/25/ldaca-metadata-ecosystem-eresearch-2022/Slide22.png&quot; alt=&quot;  &quot; title=&quot;Slide: 22&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For larger collections the approach used by PARADISEC and most LDaCA collections is to store each Object or Item (typically a related set of recordings, or a single document) in a directory (or directory-like thing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this mode, each Object MUST link back to the Collection Object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Collection Object MAY have explicit listing of hasMember properties - which makes it possible to construct repository navigation (such as websites) more cheaply. This is the approach used in PARADISEC, while in LDaCA these links are constructed by an indexer servicer or summarizer application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This screenshot shows the Language Data Commons RO-Crate Profile in action. This is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Arkisto-Platform/describo-online&quot;&gt;Describo Online&lt;/a&gt; metadata editor, with configuration that reflects the profile being used to describe a language data collection using linked-data metadata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case the description is of the collection object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the data is described, we ingest it into a repository, as a set of files on disk or object storage and index it in a portal, as you can see in these screenshots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This example notebook explores the collection via the rest API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation we have shown the major components of an ecosystem for storing, discovering and analysing language data using common standards for describing objects in a repository. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/&quot;&gt;RO-Crate&lt;/a&gt; standard is used as the key metadata container, with a common vocabulary of language specific terms for describing data. This approach should reduce development costs and increase data reuse. The approach can also be adapted to other disciplines and domains with the development only of new profiles..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Language Data Commons of Australia Data Partnerships (LDaCA) and the Australian Text Analytics Platform (ATAP) are building towards a scalable and flexible language data and analytics commons. These projects will be part of the Humanities and Social Sciences Research Data Commons (HASS RDC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Data Commons will focus on preservation and discovery of distributed multi-modal language data collections under a variety of governance frameworks. This will include access control that reflects ethical constraints and intellectual property rights, including those of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander, migrant and Pacific communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The platform will provide workbench services to support computational research, starting with code-notebooks with no-code research tools provided in later phases. Research artefacts such as code and derived data will be made available as fully documented research objects that are re-runnable and rigorously described. Metrics to demonstrate the impact of the platform are projected to include usage statistics, data and article citations. These projects are led by Professor Michael Haugh of the School of Languages and Culture at the University of Queensland with several partner institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2022/11/20/fair-care-eresearch-2022/Slide03.png&quot; alt=&quot;  &quot; title=&quot;Slide: 3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year at eResearch Australasia, the Language Data Commons of Australia (LDaCA) team presented a design for a distributed access control system which could look after the A-is-for-accessible in FAIR data; in this presentation we describe and demonstrate a pilot system based on that design, showing how data licenses that allow access by identified groups of people to language data collections can be used with an AAF pilot system (CILogon) to give the right people access to data resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ARDC have invested in a pilot of this work as part of the HASS Research Data Commons and Indigenous Research Capability Program integration activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system has to be able to implement data access policies with real-world complexity and one of our challenges has been developing a data access policy that works across a range of different collections of language data. Here we present a pilot data access policy that we have developed, describing how this policy captures the decisions that must be made by a range of data providers to ensure data accessibility that complies with diverse legal, moral and ethical considerations.
We will discuss how the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gida-global.org/care&quot;&gt;CARE&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618&quot;&gt;FAIR&lt;/a&gt; principles underpin this work, and compare this work to other projects such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://ardc.edu.au/project/cadre/&quot;&gt;CADRE&lt;/a&gt;, which promise to deliver more complex solutions in the future. Initial work is with collections curated in a research context but we will also address community access to these resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is to separate safe storage of data from its delivery. Each item in a repository is stored with licensing information in natural language (English at the moment, but could be other languages) and the repository defers access decisions to an Authorization system, where data custodians can design whatever process they like for granting license access. This can range from simple click-through licenses where anyone can agree to license terms, to detailed multi-step workflows where applicants are vetted based on whatever criteria the rights holder wishes; qualifications, membership of a cultural group, have they paid a subscription fee, etc&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2022/11/20/fair-care-eresearch-2022/Slide04.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding rights, our project is informed by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gida-global.org/care&quot;&gt;CARE&lt;/a&gt; principles for Indigenous data which also describe the level of respect which should be given to any data collected from individuals or communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current movement toward open data and open science does not fully engage with Indigenous Peoples rights and interests. Existing principles within the open data movement (e.g. FAIR: findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) primarily focus on characteristics of data that will facilitate increased data sharing among entities while ignoring power differentials and historical contexts. The emphasis on greater data sharing alone creates a tension for Indigenous Peoples who are also asserting greater control over the application and use of Indigenous data and Indigenous Knowledge for collective benefit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2022/11/20/fair-care-eresearch-2022/Slide05.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are designing the system so that it can work with diverse ways of expressing access rights, for example we are considering how the approach described here could be extended based on the likes of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://localcontexts.org/labels/traditional-knowledge-labels/&quot;&gt;Tribal Knowledge labels&lt;/a&gt;, incorporating them into the data licensing framework we discuss below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2022/11/20/fair-care-eresearch-2022/Slide06.png&quot; alt=&quot;Case Study - Sydney Speaks  &quot; title=&quot;Slide: 6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we look at a case-study with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://slll.cass.anu.edu.au/sydney-speaks&quot;&gt;Sydney Speaks project&lt;/a&gt; via LDaCA steering committee member Professor &lt;a href=&quot;https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1410-3268&quot;&gt;Catherine Travis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project seeks to document and explore Australian English, as spoken in Australia’s largest and most ethnically and linguistically diverse city – Sydney.
The title “Sydney Speaks” captures a key defining feature of the project: the data come from recorded conversations between Sydney siders, as they tell stories about their lives and experiences, their opinions and attitudes. This allows us to measure how their lived experiences impact their speech patterns.
Working within the framework of variationist sociolinguistics, we examine variation in phonetics, grammar and discourse, in an effort to answer questions of fundamental interest both to Australian English, and language variation and change more broadly, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How has Australian English as spoken in Sydney changed over the past 100 years?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has the change in the ethnic diversity over that time period (and in particular, over the past 40 years) had any impact on the way Australian English is spoken?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What affects the way variation and change spread through society - Who are the initiators and who are the leaders in change? - How do social networks function in a modern metropolis? - What social factors are relevant to Sydney speech today, and over time (gender? class? region? ethnic identity?)
A better understanding of what kind of variation exists in Australian English, and of how and why Australian English has changed over time can help society be more accepting of speech variation and even help address prejudices based on ways of speaking.

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collection contains recordings of people speaking, both contemporary and historic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because this involved human participants there are restrictions on the distribution of data - a situation we see with lots of studies involving people in a huge range of disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are four tiers of data access we need to enforce and observe for this data based on the participant agreements and ethics arrangements under which the data were collected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concerns about rights and interests are important for any data involving people - and a large amount the data both indigenous and non-indigenous we are using will require access control that ensures that data is shared with the right users under the right conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets go over some basics, starting with &lt;em&gt;licences&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A licence in this context is &lt;em&gt;a natural language document&lt;/em&gt; in which a copyright holder sets out the terms and conditions of use for data. Licences &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; have metadata that describes them, eg a property to say that this is an open licence (and does not require a check when serving data).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A license is not a computer program, or configuration, or an AI entity that can make decisions, it’s a legal document. You may also know this as a “data sharing agreement” or “terms of use”. Examples of licenses we see all the time are the GNU GPL or the various Creative Commons licenses which grant rights to others to redistribute a creative work, and specifies conditions on what changes are permitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, metadata &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; a license can be used to automate decision making - if it is labelled as being an open license, then a repository can serve data and include that data, if it is labeled as “closed” or more aptly, “authorization-required” then repository software can perform an authorization step, which we cover in detail later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the world of research data generated by or about human participants, licenses can’t always allow unauthenticated access and data redistribution, and they may permit distribution only to certain people, or classes or person. Some data, for example (particularly that which has not been or cannot be de-identified) can only be made available to the original research team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2022/11/20/fair-care-eresearch-2022/Slide09.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Dall-e prompt : A sad dog sitting on an iceberg, XKCD)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, a license is a document that expresses conditions such as “Data can be used by other researchers”, but unfortunately we don’t have systems in the research-data ecosystem which can automatically identify a user as “a researcher” (this may be surprising to some, but the Australian Access Federation can, at this stage, only say that someone has an account with an institution - it can’t tell a professor from a student administration officer and there are certainly no lists of “certified linguists”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some cold hard facts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t have an authority that can identify someone as a researcher,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or a “linguist”,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or an “anthropologist”,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or a member of an ARC (Australian Research Council) research project,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://ardc.edu.au/project/cadre/&quot;&gt;CADRE&lt;/a&gt; project is working on systems that will eventually support all these things, but they are not available as services yet, and their initial focus is on government data, so we have to work out ways for our data custodians to make decisions on who is considered an “other researcher” in the absence of attribute-based authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2022/11/20/fair-care-eresearch-2022/Slide10.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The access control system we have been prototyping is based on licenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For any data object, which could be an entire collection, or one set of recordings of a speaker in a speech study, or a set of hand written linguistic field notes from the 1950s, or a novel etc we store a license with it. This means that future archivists / librarians and researchers can work out how to manage the data if the systems we build today for automated access are no longer operational and we give the license an ID which is a URL we can use to identify it uniquely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This diagram shows how a license is explicitly linked to the data using a metadata description standard known as “Research Object Crate” &lt;a href=&quot;http://ptsefton.com/2019/11/05/RO-Crate%20eResearch%20Australasia%202019/index.html&quot;&gt;RO-Crate&lt;/a&gt; . Each object in the repository is a crate, with a metadata file that describes the object and (optionally) its component files, including the data license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2022/11/20/fair-care-eresearch-2022/Slide11.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This diagram has been updated from the one presented at eResearch to show two portals instead of one)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every item in a repository has a license, which may be an open one like CC Share Alike or a custom license derived from the ethics and participants agreements for a study in the context of local laws and institutional policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this license, distributed access portals in our architecture can check against an authorization system for each request for data. The portals may both host data with the same licensing but do not need to maintain access control lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2022/11/20/fair-care-eresearch-2022/Slide12.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Images: Various baskets of puppies by DALL-E)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we first developed access controls for LDaCA in 2021 it was a requirement that data licensing and access control decisions be decoupled from each other, and from particular repository software. The usual approach in repositories is to build in a local access-control system, but this is tied to a particular implementation and will not work in a distributed environment where there are multiple different repositories, and services such as computational resources that researchers need to access to process data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could not find an available open source system for managing license-based access to data, so our starting approach used groups as a proxy for granting licences on that basis that all common user-directory services such as LDAP include the concept of user groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scope:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;simplest possible license based approach to access control&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOT attempting to be attribute based as that is not currently feasible within our project scope (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://ardc.edu.au/project/cadre/&quot;&gt;CADRE&lt;/a&gt; for progress in that direction)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2022/11/20/fair-care-eresearch-2022/Slide13.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2022/11/20/fair-care-eresearch-2022/Slide13.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Slide: 13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first prototype, which we presented at eResearch Australasia last year was a proof-of-concept Github based system. This demonstrated that authorization can be delegated from a repository to an external service. For each of the Sydney Speaks licenses there was a Github group (organization). The repository, when requested to serve data would get the user to login using the Github Authentication services, then check if the user was in the correct license group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This worked, but there were issues with this approach:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no workflow options (unless we build a workflow system), just adding people to a Github organisation to pre-authorize them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system only supported a single logon service, which is not widely used in academia or by community groups&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we talked to the our colleagues at the Australian Access Federation (AAF), about a supported, research-sector-wide service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2022/11/20/fair-care-eresearch-2022/Slide14.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2022/11/20/fair-care-eresearch-2022/Slide14.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Slide: 14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AAF, as it happened were already working with other research groups on a service called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cilogon.org/&quot;&gt;CILogon&lt;/a&gt; (hosted in the USA initially, but soon to be hosted in Australia), like Github, this service has groups (which was our way of associating users with licenses in the absence of a specific license-granting service), but also allows users to log in with a variety of Authentication providers, including research institutions, via the Australian Access Federation as well as social logins such as Google and Microsoft (and our old friend Github).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again this worked, but the current version of CILogon does not have particularly easy-to-use ways for a license-holder to create groups - there are a number of abstract constructs to deal with and there is currently no way to build an approval workflow using the web interface, so as with the Github trial we would have needed to build this part (all of this may change, as the software is under constant development).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/xEWXiM-jUfY&quot;&gt;nine minute silent video&lt;/a&gt; of what this looked like on YouTube for those who are really interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AAF is engaging with our project on the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a cloud-based authentication and authorisation infrastructure (AAI) to support the needs of the project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;understand and develop business process documentation for authorising access to data and services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;configure the AAI to support these business processes and to develop extensions to facilitate new functionality that may be required&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create a set of policies, standards and guidelines for managing researchers’ identity and access management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;develop support documentation, train community representatives to operate the platform, and provide support to the community managers.
The AAF has recommended CILogon &amp;amp; REMS as potential solutions to investigate &amp;amp; prototype&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CILogon is a federated identity management platform that provides the following features:
support for institutional and community logins
cross-institutional and community collaboration
federated identity and group management
a community management dashboard
OIDC connectors for downstream services that support authorisation claims for services like
REMS
BinderHub
JupyterHub
LDaCA Dashboard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;REMS (Resource Entitlement Management System) is a tool to help researchers browse resources such as datasets relevant to their research and to manage the application process for access to the resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently (after the abstract for this presentation was submitted) the AAF team made us aware of the Resource Entitlement Management System, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/CSCfi/rems&quot;&gt;REMS&lt;/a&gt;, which is an open source application out of Finland. This software is the missing link for LDaCA in that it allows a data custodian to grant licenses to users. And it works with CILogon as an Authentication layer so we can let users log in using a variety of services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the core of REMS is a set of Licenses which can then be associated with Resources - in our design this is (almost always) a one-to-one correspondence, for example we would have a licence “Sydney Speaks Data Researcher Access License” corresponding to resource that represents ALL data with that licence. These Resources can then be made available through a catalog, and workflows can be set up for pre-authorization processes ranging from single-click authorizations where a user just accepts a licence and a bot approves it, to complex forms where users upload credentials and one or more data custodians approve their request, and grant them the licence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also has features for revoking permissions, and has a full API so admin tasks can be automated (for us that’s in the future).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a user has been granted a license in a pre-authorization process then a repository can authorize access to a resource by checking with REMS to see if a given user is pre-authorized. That is, has been granted a license. Note that users do not have to find REMS on their own - they will be directed to it from data and computing services when they need to apply for pre-authorization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This interaction diagram shows the flow involved in a user applying for a data license via REMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not shown here are some design and preparation steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team read their ethics approval and participant agreements and craft one or more access agreements (AKA licenses) for a data set (NOTE: If the data can be made available automatically with just a license attached, such as when all parties have agreed that data can be Creative commons licensed, or the data is in the public domain then the following steps are not required)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team and support staff add the license to REMS, creating a “resource” a virtual offering that corresponds to any dataset that has the above license&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team add a workflow to REMS - this could range from an auto-approved click through where users can agree to license terms, through to detailed (manual) checking of their credentials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next slide shows the interactions involved in accessing data once a user has been granted the license license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This diagram shows the “access-control dance” for a user who has been granted a license in REMS obtaining access to a dataset at a data portal which gives access to data in a repository or archive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this video we demonstrate how to use REMS and how does a user request access to an LDaCA resource.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2022/11/20/fair-care-eresearch-2022/Slide19.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; title=&quot;FAQ&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://ptsefton.com/2022/11/20/fair-care-eresearch-2022/Slide19.png&quot; alt=&quot;FAQ  &quot; title=&quot;Slide: 19&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This section was added after the conference, to try to summarize the discussion and clarify requirements by starting an FAQ on this approach)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Q Why not &amp;quot;just&amp;quot; implement an access control list (ACL) in the repository?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons for the distributed approach we have taken in LDaCA:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACLs need maintenance over time - people&#39;s identities change, they retire and die, so storing a list of identifiers such as email addresses alongside content is not a viable long-term preservation strategy. Rather, we will encourage data custodians to describe in words what are permitted uses for the data, and by whom, in a license, then allow whomever is the current data custodian to manage that access in a separate administrative system. We expect these administrative systems to be ephemeral, and change over time but also to generate less friction over time as standards are developed. Expected future benefits of concentrating these processes will include that people do not have to prove the same claims they make about themselves multiple times and that it is easier for data custodians to authorize access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LDaCA data will be stored in a variety of places with separate portal applications serving data for specific purposes; if these systems all have in-built authorization schemes, even if they are the same, then we have the problem of synchronizing access control lists around a network of services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accessing data that requires some sort of authorization process is not language or humanities specific, so working with an existing application that can handle pre-authorization workflows and access-control authorization decisions is an attractive choice and should allow LDaCA to take advantage of centrally managed services with functionality that improves over time rather than having to develop and maintain our own systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If complex access controls are implemented inside a system then there is a risk that data becomes stranded inside that system and cannot be reused without completely re-implementing the access control. For example, imagine an archive of cultural material with complex access controls encoded into the business logic such as “this item is accessible only to male initiates”. Applications like this need to store user accounts with attributes on both data and user records that can be used to authorize access. There is a high risk of data being stranded in a system such as this if it is no longer supported. This will be mitigated somewhat if the rules are also expressed as licenses, perhaps a composition of Traditional Knowledge (TK) Labels - but the access system is baked-in to the application and not portable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Q: Yes but why does data need to have a license if we already have access controls?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point of Research Data Commons projects like LDaCA is to create an ecosystem where data can be re-used. For language data, this means that users, including researchers and community members, will be able to download data for certain authorised purposes and activities. The license is the way that data custodians communicate to data users (and future administrators) what those purposes activities are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A license, which is always packaged with data will allow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A user to inspect a five-year-old dataset in their downloads folder and work out what they are allowed to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An IT professional to clean up laptop that has been handed in by (or seized from – it happens) a departing faculty member.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A developer to re-create an access control replacing a decommissioned system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Q So many licenses! Sounds like a lot of work!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We expect that the overhead of writing licenses will diminish greatly over time and standard clauses and complete licenses will be established. A data depositor will be able to choose from a set of standard license terms (such as a standard “restricted to CIs and participants license” for a given repository, using that as a template to mint their own license for a given data set with its own name and ID. The user can choose a standard way of adding pre-authorized licensees (such as email invitations). This ID can then be used by an authorization system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Q So you have centralized authorization into a system that grants licenses doesn&#39;t that mean you are locked-in to that system?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, and Yes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No&lt;/strong&gt;, there is no lock in regarding the list of Licenses and pre-authorized users; licenses and access control lists can be exported via an API so it is possible to import them into another system or save them for audit purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes&lt;/strong&gt;, there is lockin, in that at this stage the workflow used to give access to users is specific to the system (such as REMS)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But&lt;/strong&gt;, because our process requires a governance step &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; in writing a license, then there is a statement of intent for re-building those processes later if needed - a step which is very likely to be missing in a system with built-in access control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, over time, we expect the administrative burden of constructing workflows will become less as standards are developed for a couple of things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Licenses can be made less complex (particularly in the context of academic studies) if they specify re-use by particular known cohorts in advance - this comes down to improving the design of studies to encourage data reuse. This may also help to simplify academic ethics processes in the medium to long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CADRE project is looking to improve pre-authorization workflows that automatically source relevant information about potential users - fetching their publication record, and potentially remembering what certifications they have, so these attributes can be used and reused for decision making. It is conceivable that this approach might be useful in cultural contexts as well to allow data custodians to manage data sharing - this is a discussion we have yet to have in the broader HASS RDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Q What if I have a really simple requirement like giving access to just a couple of people - doesn’t this license approach just add complexity?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a data item needs to be locked down to a small group of people, say the chief investigator and the participants in a recorded dialogue then an obvious implementation is to maintain a small access control list (ACL) for the item. But all of the issues identified above with application-specific ACLs are the same, no matter the size of the cohort: the data set can’t be access controlled outside of its home system. If the system is no longer running then the data may be completely inaccessible, and if there is no license document stored with the data setting out terms of re-use in general terms then there is no indication to future administrators about who, if anyone, should have access of the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Q: We don’t need a license, we have a “terms of use”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same thing. Terms of use for data are what a license does. We are designing our systems so that all the relevant terms and conditions go in one place to minimize confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AAF’s business analyst is conducting interviews with the key stakeholders.
This discovery process will collect information on the current and the “to-be” state of the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together these will establish goals and expectations and provide the basis for further prototyping a service that meets stakeholder needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process will facilitate the building of a service that empowers the data custodians, the communities and participants to manage access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basis for prototyping is iterative:
Identify
Prioritise
Pilot
Review
Update requirements&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads to a production service that meets participant, community and researcher requirements and unifies the services, policies and trust framework for the community.&lt;/p&gt;

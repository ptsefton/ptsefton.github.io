We put out at least one song video per week for a year (and counting - we're up to 58 over 53 weeks). Searchable, sortable website &lt;a href="http://teamhappyband.com/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. We learned some things, got better at performing for the phone camera and our microphones and better at mixing and publishing the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Disclosure Gail's my wife. We got married; she proposed, I &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Ct0RQv6hiN8"&gt;accepted&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Ct0RQv6hiN8"&gt;I may I might - Is this the world's best marriage proposal acceptance song?&lt;/a&gt; (It did win a prize at a Ukulele festival for best song)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This post is littered with links to our songs, sorry but there are 58 of them and &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; has to link to them.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second quarter of 2020 Gail McGlinn and I went from playing and singing in community music events (jams, gigs, get togethers) at least once a week to being at home every evening, like everyone else.  Like lots of people we decided to put our efforts into home recording, not streaming cos that would be pointless for people with basically no audience, but we started making videos and releasing them under our band name &lt;a href="http://teamhappyband.com/"&gt;Team Happy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By release I mean &amp;quot;put on Facebook&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;sometimes remember to upload to YouTube&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is about that experience and what we learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Team Happy is the name we use to perform as a duo at open mic events and the odd community or ukulele festival. We were originally called &amp;quot;The Narrownecks&amp;quot; in honour of &lt;a href="https://www.visitnsw.com/destinations/blue-mountains/katoomba-area/katoomba/attractions/narrow-neck-lookout"&gt;where we live&lt;/a&gt;, for one gig, but then we found out there's another group with that name. Actually they're much better than us, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1676961009053252"&gt;just go watch them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming in to 2020 we already had a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4yZaVNUQp5iXCojJcT2rjA"&gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; and it had a grand total of two videos on it with a handful of views - as in you could count them on your fingers. It's still a sad thing to behold, how many views we have - but it's not about views it's about getting discovered and having our songs performed by, oh I dunno, Casey Chambers? Keith Urban? (Oh yeah, that would mean we'd need views. Bugger.) Either that or it's about our personal journey and growth as people. Or continuing to contribute to our local music communities in lockdown (which is what Gail says it's about.). Seriously though, we think &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N0HbdJZsgk"&gt;I called your name&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHc3JpDdw8Y"&gt;Dry Pebbles&lt;/a&gt; would go well on someone else's album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, in late March we got out our recording gear and started. While phone cameras are fine for the quality of video we need, we wanted to do better than phone-camera sound. (Here's an example of that sound from one of our first recordings on my song &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ceePoxf0_4"&gt;Seventeen&lt;/a&gt; - it's pretty muddy, like the lighting.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="videocontainer"&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2ceePoxf0_4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial attempts to get good audio involved feeding USB-audio from a sound mixer with a built in audio interface  (a Yamaha MX10) into the phone itself and recording an audio track &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; the video - but this is clunky and you only get two tracks even though the mixer has multiple inputs. We soon graduated to using a DAW - a Digital Audio Workstation with our mixer, still only two tracks but much less mucking around with the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is more or less what we ended up with for the first few weeks - We'd record or &amp;quot;track&amp;quot; everything on the computer and then use it again to mix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Our first-generation recording rig with annoying recording via a laptop&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a thing you have to do to audio files called &lt;em&gt;mastering&lt;/em&gt; which means getting them to a suitable volume level and dynamic range for distribution. Without it loud stuff is too quiet and quiet stuff is too quiet, and the music has no &lt;em&gt;punch&lt;/em&gt;. This was a complete mystery to me to start with so I paid for online services that use AI to master tracks - kind of but not really making everything louder. At some point I started doing it myself, beginning the long process of learning the mysteries of compression and limiting and saving money. Haven't &lt;em&gt;mastered&lt;/em&gt; it yet, though. Mastering is an actual profession, by the way and I'm not going to reach those heights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, we got a  new bit of gear, the Tascam Model 12 an all in one mixer-recorder-interface that lets you track (that is record tracks) without a computer - much easier to deal with. A bit later we got a Zoom H5 portable recorder with built in mics and a couple of extra tracks for instruments so we can do stuff away from home - this got used on our month-long holiday in March 2021. Well it was almost a month, but there was a Rain Event and we came home a bit early. These machines let you capture tracks, including adding new ones without touching the computer which is a big win as far as I am concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="videocontainer"&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4_9J4QlnCkw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer;  clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_9J4QlnCkw"&gt;Gail singing Closer to fine&lt;/a&gt; on The Strand in Townsville, in North Queensland, recorded on the H5 and (partly) mixed in the car on holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a bit, and depending on the level of lockdown we'd have guests around to visit and when that was happening, we kept our distance at either end of our long lounge room and used a phone camera and microphone at each end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Our second-generation recording rig with stand-alone laptop-free tracking &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new setup made it much easier to do overdubs - capture more stuff into the Model 12 and make videos each time, like on this song of mine &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EezBl_I549o"&gt;They Say Dancing&lt;/a&gt; where I overdubbed guitar and bass over a live track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what did we learn?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perfect is the enemy of Done. Well, we knew that, but if you've decided to release a song every week, even if you're away on a holiday, or there are other things going on then there's no time to obsess over details - you have to get better at getting a useable take quickly or you won't be able to keep going for a year or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practice may not make perfect, but it's a better investment than new gear, or doing endless takes with the cameras rolling. We got better at picking a song (or deciding to write one or finish one off), playing it for a week or two and then getting the take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simplify! We learned that to get a good performance sometimes it was better for only one of us to play or sing, that fancy parts increased the chance of major errors, meaning yet another take. If in doubt (like my harmony singing that's always in doubt) we're learning to leave it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody likes us! Actually we know that's not true, some of the songs get  hundreds of plays on Facebook but not many people actually click the like button, maybe twenty or so. But then you run into people in the supermarket; they say &amp;quot;love the songs keep it up&amp;quot;! And there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; quite a few people who listen every week on FB we just can't tell they're enjoying it. There are complex reasons for this lack of engagement - some people don't like to like things so that (they think) the evil FB can't track them. I think the default auto-play for video might be a factor too - the video starts playing, and that might not be a good time, so people skip forward to something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's kind of demoralizing that it is MUCH easier to get likes with pictures of the dog.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our spoiled covid-hound, Floki - about 18 months old. Much more &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt;able on the socials than our music.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YouTube definitely doesn't like us. I figured that some of the songs we sang would attract some kind of Youtube audience - we often search to see what kinds of covers of songs are out there and thought others might find us the same way, but we get almost no views on that platform. I also thought that adding some text about the gear we used might bring in some views. For example we were pretty early adopters of the Tascam Model 12. I had tried to find out what one sounded like in real life before I bought, with no success - and I thought people might drop by to hear us, but I don't think Google/YouTube is giving us any search-juice at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Our personal favourites&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Favourite cover we did (and we actually agreee on this - Team Happy is NOT an ironic name) was &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQeS4fSSu7k"&gt;Colour my World&lt;/a&gt;. We'd just got the Tascam and Gail was able to double track herself - no mucking around with computers. We had fun that night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQeS4fSSu7k"&gt;Colour my World&lt;/a&gt; - one of our fave covers to perform&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And my favourite original? Well i'm very proud of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnfcJGVVVhU"&gt;All L'Amour for you&lt;/a&gt; with lots of words and a bi-lingual pun - I wanted to do that on the local community radio just last weekend when we were asked in, but the host Richard 'Duck' Keegan kind of mentioned the aforementioned &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N0HbdJZsgk"&gt;I Called Your Name&lt;/a&gt; so we did that instead along with &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHc3JpDdw8Y"&gt;Dry Pebbles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ceePoxf0_4"&gt;Seventeen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="videocontainer"&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XnfcJGVVVhU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer;  clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnfcJGVVVhU"&gt;All L'Amour for you&lt;/a&gt; The last word on love and metaphors for love? By Peter Sefton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gail's fave original? &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Ct0RQv6hiN8"&gt;I may I might&lt;/a&gt;, the song that snagged her the best husband in South Katoomba over 1.95m tall. And she likes the tear jerker &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkfbSeDXUVo"&gt;Goodbye Mongrel dog&lt;/a&gt; I wrote, on which she pays some pumpin' banjo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkfbSeDXUVo"&gt;Goodbye Mongrel dog&lt;/a&gt; - a song that says goodbye to a (deceased) Mongrel dog who went by the name of Spensa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Music-tech stuff and mixing tips&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who care, here's a roundup of the main bits of kit that work well. We've reached the point where there's actually nothing on the shopping list - we can do everything for the foreseeable future with what we have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have mentioned that we track using the Tascam Model 12 and the Zoom H5 - these are both great. The only drawback of the Zoom is that you can't see the screen (and thus the levels) from performance position. It also needed a better wind shield - I bought a dead-cat, shaggy thing to go over the mics that works if the wind is moderate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I bought the Tascam I thought it was going to be all analogue through the mixer stage like their Model 16 and Model 24, but no, it's all digital. I don't think this is an issue having used it but it was not something they made all that explicit at launch. There's a digital Zoom equivalent (the L12) which is a bit smaller, and has more headphone outputs but at the expense of having to do mode-switching to to access all the functions. I think the Tascam will be easier to use for live shows when those start happening again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For video we just use our phones - for a while we had matching Pixel 4XLs then a Pixel 5 which drowned in a tropical stream. Yes they're waterproof, those models, but not when they have tiny cracks in the screen. No more $1000 phones for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reaper.fm/"&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt; is bloody marvelous software. It's cheap for non-commercial use, incredibly powerful and extensible. I have not used any other Digital Audio Workstation other than Garage Band, that comes for free on the Apple Platform but as far as I can see there's no reason for non-technophobic home producers to pay any more than the Reaper fee for something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our mainstay mics are a slightly battered pair of &lt;a href="https://www.soundonsound.com/reviews/audio-technica-at2020"&gt;Audio Technica AT2020&lt;/a&gt;s - we had these for performing live with Gail's band U4ria - everyone gathered around a condenser mic, bluegrass style. For recording we either put one at either end of the room or mount them vertically in an X/Y configuration - 90° to get stereo. They're fairly airy and have come to be a big part of our sound. We tried some other cheap things that didn't work very well, and I got a pair of Australian &lt;a href="https://www.soundonsound.com/reviews/rode-m5"&gt;Rode M5&lt;/a&gt; pencil condenser mics, not expensive, that I hoped might be easier to mount X/Y but we didn't like them for vocals at all, though they're great on stringed instruments. We do have an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shure_SM58"&gt;SM58&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shure_SM57"&gt;SM57&lt;/a&gt; -- gotta love a microphone with a wikipedia page -- which see occasional use as vocal mics if we want a more rock 'n roll sound, or the guest singer is more used to a close-mic. And the SM57 for guitar amps sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tend to play our favourite acoustic instruments but when we have bass we use the Trace Elliot Elf amp which has a great compressor and a DI output (it can send a signal to the mixer/interface without going via the speaker). Sometimes we run the speaker and try not to let it bleed too much into the AT2020s, very occasionally we wear headphones for the first track and go direct so there's no bass bleed. I have done a bit of electric guitar with the Boss Katana 50 - to me it sounds good in the room that amp, but has not recorded well either via the headphone out or via an SM57. I get better results thru the bass amp. I don't have any kind of actual electric guitar &lt;em&gt;tone&lt;/em&gt; sorted though I have seen lot of videos about how to achieve the elusive &lt;em&gt;tone&lt;/em&gt;. Maybe one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that I wasn't expecting to happen - I dropped the top E of my little Made in Mexico Martin OOO Jr guitar to D (you know, like Keef) some time early in 2020 and it ended up staying there. Gives some nice new chord voicings (9ths mostly) and it's the same top 4 strings as a 5 string banjo with some very easy-to-grab chords. Have started doing it to Ukuleles too, putting them in open C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A note on the bass:&lt;/strong&gt;  Playing bass is fun (we knew that before we started) but mixing it so it can be heard on a phone speaker is a real challenge. One approach that helps is using an acoustic bass which  out of a lot more high frequency than a solid body electric this also helps because you don't have to have an amp on while you're tracking it live, but you can take a direct input from a pickup (or two) AND mic the bass giving you lots of signals with different EQ to play with.  I gaffa-taped a guitar humbucker into my Artist Guitars 5 string acoustic and it sounds &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic (ha!) trick I try to use for getting more high frequency for tiny speakers is to create a second track, saturate the signal with distortion and/or saturation effects to boost the upper harmonic content and then cut all the low frequency out and mix that so it can &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; be heard and &lt;em&gt;imply&lt;/em&gt; the fundamental bass frequency in addition to the real bassy bass. Helps if you have some bridge pickup or under-saddle pickup in the signal if those are available and if you remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also like to add some phaser effect that gives some motion in the upper frequencies - for example my &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItqXJ1zsvqg"&gt;Perfect Country Pop Song&lt;/a&gt; - too much phaser? Probably, but I can hear the bass on my phone and it &lt;em&gt;bounces&lt;/em&gt; :). Phaser is Team Happy's favourite effect, nothing says perfect country pop (which is what we are, right?) like a phaser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="videocontainer"&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ItqXJ1zsvqg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer;  clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItqXJ1zsvqg"&gt;Perfect Country Pop Song&lt;/a&gt; - is it perfect or merely sublime? (This one has a cute puppy in it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything I know about music production is from YouTube. Everything I know about song writing is from deep in my soul. Thank you for reading all the way to the bottom. Normal service will resume next week.&lt;/p&gt;

So my current bugbear is university processes that seem to forget that the
actual work of higher ed is doing research and/ or teaching. This &amp;quot;research
lifecycle&amp;quot; diagram from @UW is a stunning &lt;a href="https://www.washington.edu/research/research-home-page/research-lifecycle-main-t1-blowout-2/"&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;img alt="The UW MyResearch Lifecycle with the four stages: Plan/Propose, Setup, Manage, and Closeout" src="http://ptsefton.com/2021/04/07/rdmpic/uw.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this tweet Dr Tweedie has called out Yet Another Research Lifecycle Diagram That Leaves Out The Process Of You Know, Actually Doing Research. This process-elision happened more than once when I was working as an eResearch manager - management would get in the consultants to look at research systems, talk to the research office and graduate school and come up with a &amp;quot;journey map&amp;quot; of administrative processes that either didn't mention the actual DOING research or represented it as a tiny segment, never mind that it's, you know, the main thing researchers do when they're being researchers rather than teachers or administrators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least the consultants would usually produce a 'journey map' that got you from point A to Point B using chevrons to &amp;gt;&amp;gt; indicate progress and didn't insist that everything was a 'lifecycle'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Plan / Propose  &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Setup  &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Manage / Do Research &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Closeout
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all too commonly processes are represented using the tired old metaphor of a lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reminder: A lifecycle is a biological process; how organisms come into existence, reproduce and die via various means including producing seeds, splitting themselves in two, um, making love, laying eggs and so on.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's really stretching the metaphor to talk about research in this way - maybe the research outputs in the UW &amp;quot;closeout&amp;quot; phase are eggs that hatch into new bouncing baby &lt;em&gt;proposals&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regrettably, arranging things in circles and using the &amp;quot;lifecycle&amp;quot; metaphor is very common - see this Google image search for &amp;quot;Research Lifecycle&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://ptsefton.com/2021/04/07/rdmpic/research_lifecycle_search.png"/&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if the diagramming tools that are available to people are part of the issue - Microsoft Word, for example can build cycles and other diagrams out of a bullet list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I thought it would be amusing to draw the UW diagram from above as a set cogs but this happened - you can only have 3 cogs in a Word diagram.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://ptsefton.com/2021/04/07/rdmpic/cogs.png" alt="Attempt to use Microsoft Word to make a diagram 4 cogs for Plan/Propose, Setup, Manage, and Closeout but it will only draw three of them" &gt;
&lt;a id="main"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Research Data Management as a Cycle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I've got that off my chest let's look at research data management. Here's a diagram which is in fairly wide use, from &lt;a href="https://guides.library.ucsc.edu/datamanagement/"&gt;The University of California&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://ptsefton.com/2021/04/07/rdmpic/ResearchCycleUCSC.jpg" alt=""&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This image has a CC-BY logo which means I can use it if I attribute it - but I'm not 100% clear on the original source of the diagram - it seems to be from UC somewhere.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- There's a JCU version https://libguides.jcu.edu.au/research-data-management-toolkit --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marco used this one in some presentations we gave. I thought we could do better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good part of this diagram is that it shows research data management as a cyclical, recurring activity - which for FAIR data it needs to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I don't like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it is trying to show a project (ie grant) level view of research with data management happening in ONE spot on the journey. Typically researchers do research all the time (or in between teaching or when they can get time on equipment) not at a particular point in some administrative &amp;quot;journey map&amp;quot;. We often hear feedback that their research is a lifetime activity and does not happen the way administrators and IT think it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Archive&amp;quot; is shown as a single-step pre-publication. This is a terrible message; if we are to start really doing FAIR data then data need to be described and made findable and accessible ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big so-called lifecycle is (to me) very contrived and looks like a librarian view of the world with data searching as a stand-alone process before research data management planning. Not clear whether &lt;em&gt;Publication&lt;/em&gt; means articles or data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Data Search / Reuse&amp;quot; is a type of &amp;quot;Collection&amp;quot;, and why is it happening before data management planning? &amp;quot;Re-Collection&amp;quot; is also a kind of collection, so we can probably collapse all those together (the &lt;em&gt;Findable&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Accessible&lt;/em&gt; in FAIR).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not clear whether Publication means articles or data or both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most research uses some kind of data storage but very often not directly; people might be interacting with a lab notebook system or a data repository - at UTS we arrived at the concept of &amp;quot;workspaces&amp;quot; to capture this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The &amp;quot;Minimum Viable FAIR Diagram&amp;quot;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marco and I have a sketch of a new diagram that attempts to address these issues and addresses what needs to be in place for broad-scale FAIR data practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of the FAIR principles suggest services that need to be in place; ways to &lt;em&gt;Find&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Access&lt;/em&gt; data. The I and R in FAIR are not something that can be encapsulated in a service, as such, rather they imply that data are well described for re-use and &lt;em&gt;Interoperation&lt;/em&gt; of systems and in &lt;em&gt;Reusable&lt;/em&gt; formats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it happens, there is a common infrastructure component which encapsulates &lt;em&gt;finding&lt;/em&gt;  data and &lt;em&gt;accessing&lt;/em&gt;; the repository.  Repositories are services which hold data and make it discoverable and accessible, with governance that ensures that data does not change without notice and is available for access over agreed time frames - sometimes with detailed access control.  Repositories may be general purpose or specialized around a particular type of data: gene sequences, maps, code, microscope images etc. They may also be ad-hoc - at a lab level they could be a well laid out, well managed file system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some well-funded disciplines have established global or national repositories and workflows for some or all of their data, notably physics and astronomy, bioinformatics, geophysical sciences, climate and marine science. Some of these may not be thought of by their community as repositories -  but according to our functional definition they are repositories, even if they are &amp;quot;just&amp;quot; vast shared file systems or databases where everyone knows what's what and data managers keep stuff organized. Also, some institutions have institutional data repositories but it is by no means common practice across the whole of the research sector that data find their way into any of these repositories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remember: data storage is not all files-on-disks&lt;/strong&gt;. Researchers use a very wide range of tools which may make data inaccessible outside of the tool. Examples include: cloud-based research (lab) notebook systems in which data is deposited alongside narrative activity logs; large shared virtual laboratories where data are uploaded; Secure eResearch Platforms (SERPs) which allow access only via virtualized desktops with severely constrained data ingress and egress; survey tools; content management systems; digital asset management systems; email (yes, it's true some folks use email as project archives!); to custom-made code for a single experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our general term for all of the infrastructures that researchers use for RDM day to day including general purpose storage is “workspaces”.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many, if not most &lt;em&gt;workspaces&lt;/em&gt; do not have high levels of governance, and data may be technically or legally inaccessible over the long term. They should not be considered as suitable archives or repositories - hence our emphasis on making sure that data can be described and deposited into general purpose, standards-driven repository services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is a snapshot of the core parts of an idealised FAIR data service. It shows the activities that researchers undertake, acquiring data from observations, instruments and by reuse, conducting analysis and data description in a working environment, and depositing results into one or more repositories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wanted it to show:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That infrastructure services are required for research data management - researchers don't just &amp;quot;Archive&amp;quot; their data without support - they and those who will reuse data need repository services in some form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That research is conducted using workspace environments - more infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img src="http://ptsefton.com/2021/04/07/rdmpic/new-diagram.png" alt="A work-in-progress sketch of FAIR research data management." &gt;
&lt;p&gt;We (by which I mean Marco) will make this prettier soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yes, there is a legitimate cycle in this diagram it's the FIND -&amp;gt; ACCESS -&amp;gt; REUSE -&amp;gt; DESCRIBE -&amp;gt; DEPOSIT cycle that's inherent in the FAIR lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things that might still be missing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some kind of rubbish bin - to show that workspaces are ephemeral and working data that doesn't make the cut may be culled, and that some data is held only for a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think's missing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thoughts anyone?  Comments below or take it up on twitter with @ptsefton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research data is special - like snowflakes - and I don’t mean that in a mean way, Research Data could be anything - any shape any size and researchers are also special, not always 100% aligned with institutional priorities, they align with their disciplines and departments and research teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

' title='4' border='1'  width='85%'/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s obvious that buying storage doesn’t mean you’re doing data management well but that doesn’t mean it’s not worth restating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So &amp;quot;data storage is not data management&amp;quot;. In fact, the opposite might be true - think about buying a laptop - do you just get one that fits all your stuff and rely on getting a bigger one every few years? Or do you get a smaller main drive and learn how to make sure that your data's actually archived somewhere? That would be &lt;em&gt;managing&lt;/em&gt; data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And remember that not all research data is the same “shape” as corporate data - it does not all come in database or tabular form - it can be images, video, text, with all kinds of structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far we’ve just looked at things from an infrastructure perspective but that’s not actually why we’re here, us with jobs in eResearch. I think we’re here to help researchers do &lt;em&gt;excellent&lt;/em&gt; research with &lt;em&gt;integrity,&lt;/em&gt; AND we need to help our institutions and researchers manage &lt;em&gt;risk&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research which all research organizations  need to adhere to if we get ARC or NHMRC grants sets out some institutional responsibilities to provide infrastructure and training&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are risks associated with research data, reputational, financial and risks to individuals and communities about whom we hold data&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At UTS, we’ve embraced the Research Data Management Plan - as a way to assist in dealing with this risk. RDMPs have a mixed reputation here in Australia - some organizations have decided to keep them minimal and as streamlined as possible but at UTS the thinking is that they can be useful in addressing a lot of the issues raised so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where’s the data for project X - when there’s an integrity investigation. Were procedures followed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much storage are we going to need?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the (defunct?) Research Data Lifecycle project that was conceived by the former  organizations that became the Australian Research Data Commons (ANDS, NeCTAR and RDSI) we came up with this architecture for a central research data management system (in our case we use the open source ReDBox system) loosely linked to a variety of research Workspaces, as we call them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan is that over time, researchers can plan and budget for data management in the short, medium and long term, provision services and use the system to archive data as they go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;' title='11' border='1'  width='85%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UTS has been an early adopter of the OCFL (Oxford Common File Layout) specificiation - a way of storing file sustainably on a file system (coming soon: s3 cloud storage) so it does not need to be migrated. I &lt;a href="https://eresearch.uts.edu.au/2019/07/01/OCLF.htm"&gt;presented on this at the Open Repositories conference&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;' title='12' border='1'  width='85%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And at the same conference, I introduced the RO-Crate standards effort, which is a marriage between the DataCrate data packaging work we’ve been doing at UTS for a few years, and the Research Object project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;' title='13' border='1'  width='85%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We created the Arkisto platform to bring together all the work we’ve been doing to standardise research data metadata, and to build a toolkit for sustainable data repositories at all scales from single-collection up to institutional, and potentially discipline and national collections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an example of one of many Arkisto deployment patterns you can read more on the &lt;a href="https://arkisto-platform.github.io/use-cases/"&gt;Arkisto Use Cases page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an example of an Arkisto-platform output. Data exported from one content management system into an archive-ready RO-Crate package, which can then be made into a live site. This was created for Ass Prof Tamson Pietsch at UTS. The website is ephemeral - the data will be Interoperable and Reusable (I and R from FAIR) via the use of RO-Crate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now to higher-level concerns: I built this infrastructure for my chooks (chickens) - they have a nice dry box with a roosting loft. But most of the time they roost on the roof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know all too well that researchers don’t always use the infrastructure we build for them - you have to get a few other things right as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the big frustrations I have had as an eResearch manager is that the expectations and aspirations  of funders and integrity managers and so on are well ahead of our capacity to deliver the services they want, and then when we DO get infrastructure sorted there are organizational challenges to getting people to use it. To go back to my metaphor, we can’t just pick up the researchers from the roof and put them in their loft, or spray water on them to get them to move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Via Gavin Kennedy and Guido Aben from AARNet Marco La Rosa and I are helping out with this charmingly named project which is adding data management service to storage, syncronization and sharing services. Contracts not yet in place so won't say much about this yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CS3MESH4EOSC  -  Interactive and agile sharing mesh of storage, data and applications for EOSC - aims to create an interoperable federation of data and higher-level services to enable friction-free collaboration between European researchers.
CS3MESH4EOSC will connect locally and individually provided services, and scale them up at the European level and beyond, with the promise of reaching critical mass and brand recognition among European scientists that are not usually engaged with specialist eInfrastructures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like, you, know, they did with the copyright in publications. Not only did that industry work out how to take over copyright in research works, they successfully moved from selling us hard-copy resources that we could keep in our own libraries  to charging an annual rent on the literature - getting to the point where they can argue that they are essential to maintaining the scholarly record and MUST be involved in the publishing process even when the (sometimes dubious, patchy) quality checks are performed by &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt; who created the literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s up to research institutions whether this story repeats with research data - remember who you’re dealing with when you sign those contracts!&lt;/p&gt;

How many research institutions in Australia have secure, scalable, sustainable Research Data repositories that support FAIR practices?
When are we going to have national repositories?
How many of the eResearch Platforms funded under various programs have sustainable data management stories? How much data is locked-up behind APIs and will be inaccessible if the software stops running?
&lt;p&gt;' title='25' border='1'  width='85%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 2010s the Australian National Data (ANDS) service funded investment in Metadata stores; one of these was the ReDBOX research data management platform which is alive and well and being sustained by QCIF with a subscription maintenance service. But ANDS didn’t fund development of Research Data Repositories.&lt;/p&gt;

The position was declared to be redundant under the &amp;quot;Voluntary Separation Program&amp;quot;. I guess the corporate maths works for UTS and it works for me. Thanks COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the third redundancy for me, and apart from fleeting feelings of uselessness, bitterness and mild despair being redundant, and of no use to anyone any more, has worked out fine for me in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've enjoyed working at UTS for the past nearly six years - this year was challenging for a lot of people, but working from home suited me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My colleagues and I built a good strong eResearch team, developed an eResearch strategy, and worked towards it, reporting as we went (see last year's &lt;a href="https://eresearch.uts.edu.au/eresearch/strategy-2019/"&gt;update on 2019&lt;/a&gt;). The team provides &amp;quot;full-stack&amp;quot; support - from racking and stacking servers to policy and strategy development; from one-on-one help with coding problems to faculty research committee meetings about data management planning. Every one of the team works directly with our stakeholders from research students to Deputy Vice Chancellors. As I leave, UTS has a new joined-up Research Systems Strategic Plan to which we all contributed ready to go, and the team has clear strategies for Research Data Management and computing support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why did I go for the &amp;quot;separation&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get a decent amount money, so I can have a break and have a think about what to do next, which I think will involve working on similar eResearch things internationally, nationally and for individual organizations.  Job number one, a small but I hope impactful international consulting gig is reaching the contract stage. I'll also keep working on the Research Object Crate (&lt;a href="http://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/"&gt;RO-Crate&lt;/a&gt;) spec and on the &lt;a href="http://ptsefton.com/2020/11/23/Arkisto.htm"&gt;Arkisto research platform&lt;/a&gt;. So, if you have any eResearching that wants doing please get in touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To spend more time with the family. Actually that's not really a major factor with the eight kids Gail McGlinn and I have between us all grown up, but the dog will appreciate having me around and we are taking a road trip North to Cairns in March with visits to family and friends, pandemic willing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid a &amp;quot;non-voluntary separation&amp;quot;; there are several not unlikely scenarios under which this might have happen in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have accepted an honorary position as a Visiting Fellow in the School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences, within the Faculty of Science so I can keep working with some of the research teams on data management and analytical pipelines, and will sit on an advisory committee that I'll tell you about next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core eResearch team had an end-of-2020/bye-bye-Petie get together. A couple of people couldn't make it but the rest of us chartered a double-decker and had a bit of a tour of the upper Blue Mountains followed by fully catered lunch. I can only hope that I came half way to the standard of the UTS Ariel Function Centre with my humble efforts at the stove, and some knife work from Pascal and Anselm (pictured below) on the side dishes.&lt;/p&gt;

And I'd forgotten how much Coach Captain banter eclipses mere dad jokes - and our captain Michael has been coach captaining for 34 years so he has all the good patter. &lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research data from all disciplines has interest and value that extends beyond funding cycles and must continue to be managed and preserved for the long term. However much of the effort in eResearch goes into building systems which provide functionality and services that operate on data but which actually put data at risk, that is, by loading data into a particular tool so that  the data is not be easily retrievable if the service cannot be sustained, or, at worst, the data is lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arkisto (https://arkisto-platform.github.io/why/) approach is to work with a set of standards which make data available for long term access. Using the Oxford Common File Layout (OCFL) to organize data in a repository and Research Object Crate to describe data down to the file or even variable level Arkisto supports the safeguarding of data for the long term. A growing set of Arkisto-compatible software tools allow data ingest into repositories, and the creation of data discovery portals that connect data to analytical, visualisation and computing tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation we will introduce the standards based platform and show a number of examples from multiple disciplines of current Arkisto deployments, including an institutional Research Data Portal, a snapshot of the Expert Nation history project, crowd-sourced data from historical criminology , and the Pacific And Regional Archive for Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures (PARADISEC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the sector we build services  that operate on data but which actually put data at risk, that is, by loading data into a particular tool so that  the data is not be easily retrievable if the service cannot be sustained, or, at worst, the data is lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Arkisto (https://arkisto-platform.github.io/why/) approach is to work with a set of standards which make data available for long term access.
The closest emoji I could find to represent standards was this “standard poodle”.  Previously I used a toothbrush - on the basis that “standards are like toothbrushes, everyone wants to use their own”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🐩#1: Oxford Common File Layout&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;' title='4' border='1'  width='85%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first of the two core standards is the Oxford Common File Layout (OCFL) to organize data in a repository as a set of files. This approach is scalable indefinitely, and reduces the risk that data will be locked up in monolithic systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This diagram by Mike Lynch shows a series of different sized collections of data, each with a label. The labels (manifests)  in this case are purely about data integrity - and contain checksums. The bundles of data are the next level up as we move on to look at Standard number 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;' title='5' border='1'  width='85%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RO-Crate is the standard Arkisto uses for packaging and describing data sets. It is based on other standards:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JSON-LD - an encoding scheme for linked-data using the universally accepted JSON format (Javascript Object Notation) to encode information about Data Entities such as files and folders and Contextual Entities such as people, places, instruments, data licenses. Files can be described in detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schema.org is used as the main ontology, for classes and properties - it has coverage for all the basic Who What Where style metadata and is used by Google’s dataset search and a number of other projects. There are a few terms from other ontologies where Schema.org does not have coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RO-Crates may also have an HTML human readable summary of data. If you find a stray crate in your downloads folder it is easy to click on the HTML file and get a summary of what’s inside - they can also be hosted on the web using a plain-old webserver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On important tool is Describo, a desktop (and soon to be online) tool for describing data using the RO-Crate standard. It created linked-data descriptions that can describe a dataset at the top level, and also individual files or variable inside files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two projects working on online version of Describo - one at UTS and on led by CERN working with the European National Research Networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arkisto currently has two data discovery tools that index the contents of an OCFL repository so human and machines can discover data and connect to analytical, visualisation and computing tools. This is Michael Lynch’s diagram showing, from the left, how data can be “delivered” to a repository via standard tools (such as rsync) over SSH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An indexing process uses Solr (or another index like Elasticsearch) the RO-Crate metadata for objects builds an index that can be then used for search and faceted browsing over data. There is a user on the right, requesting access to a dataset  and a security guard checking her credentials - the user has the rights to see datasets marked with a *.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;img src='http://ptsefton.com/2020/11/23/Arkisto/Slide12.png' alt='' title='12' border='1'  width='85%'/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an example from the PARADISEC indexer. As per the Arkisto appraoacgh, PARADISEC site is data driven - objects are stored on disk in OCFL using RO-Crate for describe each research object. Indexing tools walk the OCFL filesystem looking for RO-Crates, then, using the crate metadata in addition to the OCFL inventory metadata construct appropriate indexes into the content. In this example we can see version 1 of this item and the metadata we get from the OCFL inventory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;' title='13' border='1'  width='85%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an example of faceted search interface - constructed using the Oni portal tool  developed at UTS - this is showing a data-export from the Expert Nation &lt;a href="https://expertnation.org/"&gt;https://expertnation.org/&lt;/a&gt; with the tagline “Universities, War and 1920s &amp;amp; 30s Australia” led by  Associate Professor &lt;a href="https://www.uts.edu.au/staff/tamson.pietsch"&gt;Tamson Pietsch&lt;/a&gt; - who asked us to create an archive of the state of the dataset to support a book. We are working with Pietsch’s team to configure the portal to be useful in exporting the data. The SectorName facet is particularly important; it shows that the health sector was by far the biggest employer of returned service people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is another dataset - this time we are looking at an RO-Crate sitting on a plain old web site  (not a search portal). This is a screenshot of a map with a time-window function showing where one Laura Adams was convicted of 42 offences between 1918 and 1942. The power of the Arkisto platform, based on Standards is that adding this kind of functionality to other collections with geographical features in it is a matter of writing a few simple bits of code - the component can be re-used because the data and metadata use the RO-Crate standard (which in turn is built on other standards).The data in this demonstrator came from Alana  Piper’s &lt;a href="https://criminalcharacters.com/"&gt;Criminal Characters&lt;/a&gt;  project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a screenshot of geographical data about a single offender’s sentences that has been exported in to the Time Layered Cultural Map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are working on making this an automated service so that any Arkisto portal can be configured to display relevant geo-data but also to be able to export it for analysis to other tools via APIs including at large scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researcher, Dr Alana Piper says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analytical possibilities here would be uploading all offenders in bulk and
comparing the 'range' results to determine what types of offences or other
factors are associated with higher/lower levels of mobility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A modern catalog driven from OCFL and RO-Crate. This is the landing page built from the content indexed into elastic search. We can see the number of collections, items, contributors and universities at a glance. There are controls for jumping to a specific item or collection and a simple auto complete search for quickly finding known content. The bottom half is a dynamic list of the most recently updated items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PARADISEC has viewers for various content types: video and audio with time aligned transcriptions, image set viewers and document viewers (xml, pdf and microsoft formats). We are working on making these viewers available across Arkisto sites by having a standard set of hooks for adding viewer plugins to a site as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To conclude:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arkisto is a flexible research platform which can be used to assemble  a variety of data pipelines, for a variety of disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emphasis in on FIRST keeping data safe and re-usable by storing and describing it using standards, so that in the absence of budget and resources to maintain complex virtual labs the data are still available for re-use, and THEN to use our growing set of interoperable tools to build data hubs, with re-usable data viewer plugins and standards-based interoperable analytical services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are active projects under way at the Universities of Melbourne and University of Technology Sydney across a wide range if disciplines and we are seeking funding to enhance the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post I describe a disgusting, filthy, but possibly beautiful hack* I
devised to get around a common problem in data description using semantic web
techniques, specifically JSON-LD and schema.org . How can we allow people who
don't happen to be Semantic Web über-geeks to be able to define their own
vocabularies when they need to go beyond common vocabularies like schema.org?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* You tell me - beautiful or evil?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#spoiler"&gt;Jump to the spoiler at end - actually there are two hacks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last few years most of the posts on this blog have been presentations
I've given at conferences, for example there's a series of posts on &lt;a href="https://researchobject.github.io/ro-crate/"&gt;RO-Crate&lt;/a&gt;,
the
&lt;a href="http://ptsefton.com/2019/11/05/RO-Crate%20eResearch%20Australasia%202019.htm"&gt;most recent of which&lt;/a&gt;
was from eResearch Australasia. &lt;a href="https://researchobject.github.io/ro-crate/"&gt;RO-Crate&lt;/a&gt; is a specification for describing and packaging
research data (could be any data, really, but the main use cases that drove
development come from research).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RO-Crate uses &lt;a href="https://json-ld.org/"&gt;JSON-LD&lt;/a&gt; as its main metadata format, with vocabulary terms which
mostly come from Schema.org: this makes it reasonably&lt;br /&gt;
easy for developers to write tools to generate good-quality low-ambiguity metadata in an
extensible way. I'm not going to do a full JSON-LD tutorial, but to give you an idea
RO-CRATE JSON-LD looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
    &amp;quot;@id&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;./&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;@type&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Dataset&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;My dataset&amp;quot;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is easy to work with because it's just &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON"&gt;JSON&lt;/a&gt;, with a trick up its sleeve - the keys in the JSON object, such as &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; are are defined in a 'context'. At its simplest, the context is a just a lookup between a key and a URI - in this case the context is defined like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
    &amp;quot;@context&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.0/context&amp;quot;,
    
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in the JSON document you get from &lt;a href="https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.0/context"&gt;https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.0/context&lt;/a&gt;, among a few hundred other properties is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;     &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;http://schema.org/name&amp;quot;,
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you go to &lt;a href="http://schema.org/name"&gt;http://schema.org/name&lt;/a&gt; you can read a definition of the &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having definitions is important. Let's take the metadata term &amp;quot;title&amp;quot;. In Dublin Core
&lt;a href="https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/terms/title/"&gt;title's the name of a resource&lt;/a&gt;
in
&lt;a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/#term_title"&gt;FOAF it's a title as in Mr, Mrs, Dr, Reverend etc&lt;/a&gt;
in &lt;a href="https://schema.org/title"&gt;schema.org title's a job title&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all these terms I can use a URI to get to a human readable page to read about the term but here's our problem:
not everyone has the resources to define metadata terms by making an ontology and hosting it somewhere online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what to do when you want to describe something, and provide some definitions
but there's no obvious ontology to hand?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets look at an example.
&lt;a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9369-5862"&gt;Dr Alana Piper&lt;/a&gt; at UTS has some criminal
history data, which includes transcriptions of prison records - she sent  me a
spreadsheet with data on about 2600 prison records in PDF format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the variables in Alana's data were
easy to map to schema.org vocabulary, like &lt;a href="http://schema.org/name"&gt;name&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="http://schema.org/birthDate"&gt;birthDate&lt;/a&gt; but some others that are not defined in
a handy online ontology, like &lt;code&gt;sentence&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;offence&lt;/code&gt;. You can see some sample
data of Alana's
&lt;a href="https://data.research.uts.edu.au/examples/ro-crate/examples/src/samples/ConvictionsSample/#action_1"&gt;here in an RO-Crate&lt;/a&gt;.
RO-Crates come with web-previews - this is a bit of data that refers to a
&lt;code&gt;sentence&lt;/code&gt; for one Nora Abbot for the &lt;code&gt;offence&lt;/code&gt; of Vagrancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like JSON-LD in general but if you don't define mappings for the keys you're
using then when you use JSON-LD software to process the files the undefined keys
and their values disappear from your document, which is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; user or developer
friendly. I don't like that at all - nobody expects their data to be discarded
when self-important, opinionated software library feels like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And more annoyingly, if you have an ad-hoc vocabulary there's no way to define
that in your JSON-LD file or even the data that ships with it. Context keys MUST
map to complete URLs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a workaround. You can use a catch all &lt;code&gt;@vocab&lt;/code&gt; key in the &lt;code&gt;@context&lt;/code&gt; for
your JSON-LD which points to a URI so that any undefined terms get forced into a
particular vocabulary. Schema.org does this - so if you use that context then
you use whatever terms you like and JSON-LD processors won't swallow your data
BUT that's cheating and it's not useful as you don't get real URIs that can be
resolved to read a definition of the term. You get FAKE URIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a screenshot of what the initial RO-Crate I made with Alana's data looked
like - it shows that some of terms (like &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;startTime&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;location&lt;/code&gt; are
defined - these have a question-mark link beside them you can follow to read the
definition. But a couple of others (&lt;code&gt;sentence&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;offence&lt;/code&gt;) didn't have
definitions - cos while they do map to a URI, The URI is a FAKE and it's not
listed in the official RO-Crate @context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://ptsefton.com/2020/03/24/semantic_web_hacks/sentence.png" alt="Screen capture of metadata in RO-CRATE, described above"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been thinking about this a lot, and looking for approaches
to publishing light-weight semantic web vocabs (about which I found pretty much
nothing) and eventually I came across some &lt;a href="http://ptsefton.com/2009/04/08/journal-20-embedding-semantics-in-documents.htm"&gt;very interesting work&lt;/a&gt; from ten years ago, which
looked at how to encode semantic statements into a URL for use in content
authoring systems that don't allow entry of linked data directly. The solution was to
encode semantic web stuff like &lt;code&gt;this-document&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;has-author&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3545-944X&lt;/code&gt;  into a URL. Hey, that idea could be adapted to this situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, what I came up with &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; decade was the idea of coding the entire
definition for property into a URL so we can put that URL into a local context.
Stupid? Probably. Naughty Fun that's likely to get disapproving looks from
computer scientists and semantic-web purists? Certainly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so what does a definition for a property look like? We can ask the schema.org
server about that from the command line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl  -L -H &amp;quot;Accept: application/ld+json&amp;quot; schema.org/name
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we do that, we get: some JSON-LD which I've pruned a bit here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  &amp;quot;@context&amp;quot;: {
    &amp;quot;schema&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;http://schema.org/&amp;quot;,
    ...
    &amp;quot;rdf&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;rdfa&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;http://www.w3.org/ns/rdfa#&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;rdfs&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;schema&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;http://schema.org/&amp;quot;,
   ...
  },
  &amp;quot;@id&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;schema:name&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;@type&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;rdf:Property&amp;quot;,
  
  ...
  &amp;quot;rdfs:comment&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;The name of the item.&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;rdfs:label&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;,
   ...
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seems to me the MVD (that's &amp;quot;Minimum Viable Document&amp;quot;) for defining
a property are an &lt;code&gt;@id&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;rdf:label&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;rdfs:comment&lt;/code&gt; so I threw together a
simple single-page web thing on the examples bit of our repository server at
work that would decode those out of a URL and, well, just show them to you (and I linked to it via
the venerable PURL service so it doesn't need a domain name).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a name="spoiler"&gt; 
&lt;h1&gt;Hack 1&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, my first filthy web hack was to change the code I used to generate the RO-Crate of Alana's data - fed it some extra config with definitions of her metadata terms, then set up a super simple one-page web app which ACTs like it's the documentation for an ontology, but actually, you supply your own documentation, in the form of a link, like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://purl.org/adhoc?@type=rdf:Property&amp;rdfs:label=sentence&amp;rdfs:comment=Penalty imposed by court for criminal conviction. As the data is drawn from prison records, this will usually consist of a specified term of imprisonment and the type of imprisonment conditions, e.g. 6 months hard labour. However, during this historical period it was common for persons convicted of a minor offence to be sentenced to a fine 'with the option' of a prison sentence if they were unable to pay it. After the introduction in Victoria of the Indeterminate Sentences Act in 1907, prisoners who had been declared 'habitual criminals' could also receive an indefinite sentence that meant they were imprisoned until the government authorities determined that they had sufficiently reformed. Some prisoners also faced additional penalties in addition to their prison sentence, such as periods of solitary confinement, in irons or whippings.&amp;@id=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.org%2Fadhoc%3F%40type%3Drdf%3AProperty%26rdfs%3Alabel%3Dsentence"&gt;http://purl.org/adhoc?@type=rdf:Property&amp;amp;rdfs:label=sentence&amp;amp;rdfs:comment=Penalty imposed by court for criminal conviction. As the data is drawn from prison records, this will usually consist of a specified term of imprisonment and the type of imprisonment conditions, e.g. 6 months hard labour. However, during this historical period it was common for persons convicted of a minor offence to be sentenced to a fine 'with the option' of a prison sentence if they were unable to pay it.

Some prisoners also faced additional penalties in addition to their prison sentence, such as periods of solitary confinement, in irons or whippings.&amp;amp;@id=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.org%2Fadhoc%3F%40type%3Drdf%3AProperty%26rdfs%3Alabel%3Dsentence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow that and you get a page something like this (it will change and may be removed by the internet police):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Property: sentence&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;@id: http://purl.org/adhoc?@type=rdf:Property&amp;amp;rdfs:label=sentence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Label: sentence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Description:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penalty imposed by court for criminal conviction. As the data is
drawn from prison records, this will usually consist of a specified term of
imprisonment and the type of imprisonment conditions, e.g. 6 months hard
labour. However, during this historical period it was common for persons
convicted of a minor offence to be sentenced to a fine 'with the option' of a
prison sentence if they were unable to pay it. After the introduction in
Victoria of the Indeterminate Sentences Act in 1907, prisoners who had been
declared 'habitual criminals' could also receive an indefinite sentence that
meant they were imprisoned until the government authorities determined that
they had sufficiently reformed. Some prisoners also faced additional penalties
in addition to their prison sentence, such as periods of solitary confinement,
in irons or whippings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use this property use this text Copy to clipboard &amp;lt;...&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See what I did there? Got around the limitations of JSON-LD and its (I think
harmful) insistence that context terms must resolve to URLs and supplied a
self-documenting URL which, at least in the context of RO-Crate will allow a user to see
something &lt;em&gt;useful&lt;/em&gt; when they view the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(If JSON-LD is Linked Data encoded in JSON then this must be &lt;em&gt;URL-LD&lt;/em&gt;,
linked data encoded in URLs - or is it &lt;em&gt;URI-LD&lt;/em&gt;?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hack 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having done this work, and actually put up that web page to illustrate it I then came up with what might be a more elegant solution to the actual problem at hand, which is shipping usable definitions of ad-hoc terms around in an &lt;a href="https://researchobject.github.io/ro-crate/1.0/#ro-crate-metadata-file-ro-crate-metadatajsonld"&gt;RO-Crate Metadata File&lt;/a&gt;. The trick is similar to something we already do in RO-Crate to make metadata as useful as possible. The thing is, some URIs in the semantic web world don't actually resolve to anything usable by most humans which means that in the &lt;a href="https://researchobject.github.io/ro-crate/1.0/#ro-crate-website-ro-crate-previewhtml-and-ro-crate-preview_files"&gt;RO-Crate Website&lt;/a&gt; that can accompany a crate the explanatory links are not helpful, so we came up with a way to provide links that &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; useful by adding an item to the RO-CRate metadata that species a more useful link using the &lt;em&gt;sameAs&lt;/em&gt; property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The example in the RO-Crate spec uses the BIBO &lt;code&gt;interviewee&lt;/code&gt; property. It's URL does not resolve to a useful page (that used to be because it went to an RDF file not a web page, but is doubly so at time of writing because it resolves to an error page at purl.org).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  &amp;quot;@context&amp;quot;: [ 
    &amp;quot;https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.0/context&amp;quot;,
    {&amp;quot;interviewee&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/interviewee&amp;quot;},
  ],
  &amp;quot;@graph&amp;quot;: [
  {
      &amp;quot;@id&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/interviewee&amp;quot;,
      &amp;quot;sameAs&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;http://neologism.ecs.soton.ac.uk/bibo.html#interviewee&amp;quot;,
      &amp;quot;@type&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Thing&amp;quot;
  }
 ]
}

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above offers &lt;a href="http://neologism.ecs.soton.ac.uk/bibo.html#interviewee"&gt;a more useful alternative URL&lt;/a&gt; and the code that generates the HTML summary of the RO-Crate can use that to provide a gloss [?]. But what if we actual also include the definition?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of the above outrageously big URL with all the info to define &lt;code&gt;sentence&lt;/code&gt; in it we could add this to our metadata with a made-up URL for the term and an on-board rdf:Property to define it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; &amp;quot;@context&amp;quot;: [ 
    &amp;quot;https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.0/context&amp;quot;,
    {&amp;quot;sentence&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;http://example.com/criminal-characters/sentence&amp;quot;},
  ],
&amp;quot;@graph&amp;quot;: [
  {
      &amp;quot;@id&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;http://example.com/criminal-characters/sentence&amp;quot;,
      &amp;quot;@type&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;rdf:Property&amp;quot;,
      &amp;quot;rdfs:label&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;sentence&amp;quot;,
      &amp;quot;rdf:comment&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Penalty imposed by court for criminal conviction. As the data is drawn from prison records, this will usually consist of a specified term of imprisonment and the type of imprisonment conditions, e.g. 6 months hard labour. However, during this historical period it was common for persons convicted of a minor offence to be sentenced to a fine 'with the option' of a prison sentence if they were unable to pay it.

Some prisoners also faced additional penalties in addition to their prison sentence, such as periods of solitary confinement, in irons or whippings.&amp;quot;
      }
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could then hack the RO-Crate web viewer to use the label and comment supplied here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So - what do you think?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a.  Hack 1?
b.  Hack 2?
c.  Both?
d.  Neither?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm re-posting / self-archiving this from the
&lt;a href="http://eresearch.uts.edu.au"&gt;UTS eResearch Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike Lynch and Peter Sefton attended the 2019 eResearch Australasia conference
in Brisbane from 22-24 October 2019, where we presented a few things - and a
pre-conference summit on the 21st held by the Australian Research Data Commons,
where Mike presented our report from our small discovery project on scalable
repository technology. UTS paid for the trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What we presented - our work on Simple Scalable Research Data Repositories&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've posted fleshed-out versions of our conference papers as usual. Mike
presented a short version of
&lt;a href="http://eresearch.uts.edu.au/2019/11/05/eResearch2019_lighting_ocfl_nginx.htm"&gt;ARDC funded work on data repositories&lt;/a&gt;
at both the the summit and the conference and Peter had also put in an abstract
for
&lt;a href="/2019/11/05/FAIR%20Repo%20-%20eResearch%20Presentation.htm"&gt;longer version&lt;/a&gt;
which is less technically focussed and gives more of the context for why this
work is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter &lt;a href="/2019/11/05/RO-Crate%20eResearch%20Australasia%202019.htm"&gt;presented an update on our ongoing work on describing and packaging
research data - this time focussing on the new merged standard Research Object
Crate&lt;/a&gt;(RO-Crate) and looking at what's coming next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Diversity breakfast&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I (Mike) went to the breakfast given in honour of the late Dr Jacky Pallas, a senior
figure in the eResearch community who had given a keynote at last year's
eResearch Australasia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speaker was Dr Toni Collis, a research software engineer and director of
&lt;a href="https://womeninhpc.org/"&gt;Women in High Performance Computing&lt;/a&gt;, on how lack of
diversity is damaging your research, making the point that diverse research and
support teams can be demonstrated to be more effective in terms of performance,
and the importance of equity, diversity and inclusivity in attracting and
retaining talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Research as a primary function of Electronic Health Records&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prof Nikolajz Zeps' presentation was one of a couple of talks which sold
themselves as being provocative, in that they were arguing for a loosening of
traditional, restrictive health care ethics and consent practices so that data
could be made more readily available for research. He made the point that data
sharing is very difficult in the Australian healthcare system not just because
of ethical restrictions but because the system is so fragmented. He argued for
an integration of research and clinical data consent and management practices,
which would allow the information flows required for medical research to be used
for the health care system itself to better monitor the effectiveness of
treatments and patient outcomes. Moving the consent process from one of research
ethics to clinical ethics can make things simpler, in terms of administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I was less impressed by the other provocative keynote in which the speaker said
&amp;quot;no-one ever died as the result of a health-care data breach&amp;quot;, which I thought
was a bit of posturing, even though it got applause from some of the audience.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Notable presentations&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Galaxy Australia and the Australian Bioinformatic Commons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two presentations were part of the bioinformatics stream, about the
Australian node of the global Galaxy workflow and computational platform, and
the Australian BioCommons Pathfinder Project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://conference.eresearch.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019_eResearch_96_Galaxy-Australia-%E2%80%93-the-Bring-Your-Own-Data-platform.pdf"&gt;Gareth Price, Galaxy Australia - the “Bring Your Own Data” platform enabling multi-omics analysis for biology researchers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://usegalaxy.org.au/"&gt;Galaxy Australia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;9 Reproducible Research Things&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amanda Miotto from Griffith University's eResearch team presented on
&lt;a href="http://conference.eresearch.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019-eResearch_-29-_8-Reproducible-Research-things.pdf"&gt;running workshops to introduce researchers to good reproducibility practice&lt;/a&gt; which focussed on immediate benefits, like safeguarding a research team against individual members leaving or falling ill, and practical steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://guereslib.github.io/Reproducible-Research-Things/"&gt;The workshop materials are available on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Physiome Journal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href="http://conference.eresearch.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019_eResearch_18_Peer-Reviewing-Reproducibility-The-Physiome-Journal.pdf"&gt;interesting presentation by Karin Lundengård of the Auckland Bioengineering Institute&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href="https://journal.physiomeproject.org/"&gt;Physiome Journal&lt;/a&gt;, which will publish validated and reproducible mathematical models of physiological processes. The models will also be made available as Jupyter notebooks and shared on the &lt;a href="https://gigantum.com/"&gt;Gigantum&lt;/a&gt; platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;HASS BOF&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of what we spoke about in this BOF, which was chaired by Ingrid Mason,
echoed what I (Mike) had heard the week before at a Big Data for the Digital
Humanities symposium in Canberra which was organised by the ARDC and AARNet (and
which I should write a blog post about).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenges faced by digital humanities researchers and support staff mirror
one another - researchers are unsure of the right way to engage with technical
staff and vice versa, and good collaboration is too labour-intensive to be
sustainable if it's going to be spread beyond a minority of researchers who are
already linked in to support networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gave me a kind of wistful feeling about an earlier
&lt;a href="http://conference.eresearch.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019-eResearch-Underwood-and-Carroll-1.pdf"&gt;keynote from  Dell&lt;/a&gt;
about machine learning in medical science, because the speaker was very
enthusiastic about moving HPC tools out of the realm where researchers needed to
become technology experts to use them at all, into something more like commodity
software. Although there are some areas of the humanities where this sort of
thing is starting to happen - transcription is one which came up both in
Canberra and Brisbane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Data Discovery&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I (Peter) chaired a session on Data Discovery with a couple of lead-in
talks that outlined what's going on in the world of generic research data
discovery, leading into a discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From our viewpoint at UTS it was useful to get confirmation that discovery services are converging on using
&lt;a href="https://schema.org"&gt;Schema.org&lt;/a&gt; for high-level description of data sets, for
indexing by other services. Which is good, because that's the horse we bet on at UTS.
It's being used by both &lt;a href="https://researchdata.ands.org.au/"&gt;Research Data Australia&lt;/a&gt; (RDA) and
the new player
&lt;a href="https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch"&gt;Google dataset search&lt;/a&gt; (that's run by
a tiny team apparently, but it will have a huge impact on how everyone has to
structure their metadata).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amir Aryani (Swinburne) and Melroy Almeida (Australian Access Federation)
&lt;a href="https://conference.eresearch.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019_eResearch_133_Australian-ORCID-Research-Graph.pdf"&gt;presented on ORCID graph&lt;/a&gt;
looking at collaboration networks. This is testament to the power of using
strong, URI-based identifiers, once you start doing that, metadata changes from
an un-reliable soup of differently spelled ambiguous names, to something you can
do real analytics on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adrian Burton (ARDC, ex ANDS) has been dealing with metadata a long time - he
put it that the Schema.org approach had won, and suggested that this might be a
bit of a loss. The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIF-CS"&gt;RIF-CS&lt;/a&gt; standard that ANDS
inherited and built RDA around had a entity based model, with Collections,
Parties, Activities and services (based on
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_2146"&gt;ISO 2146&lt;/a&gt;) rather than simple flat
name-value metadata. I agree that the entity model was a strength of RIF-CS But
actually, for those that want to convey rich context about data, then schema.org
with linked data can do everything RIF-CS can, more elegantly and with more
detail. See the work we've been doing on &lt;a href="/2019/11/05/RO-Crate%20eResearch%20Australasia%202019.htm"&gt;RO-Crate&lt;/a&gt; which takes things to a
deeper level with descriptions of files and (soon) even variables inside files
including provenance chains (what people and equipment did to &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; those files
from observations, or other files).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leaders of that session have done a follow up survey, so I think they'll be
putting out more info soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Preservation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/2019/11/05/RO-Crate%20eResearch%20Australasia%202019.htm"&gt;RO-Crate talk&lt;/a&gt; I gave (Peter here) was in a stream on Digital Preservation and data packaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ErinGLib"&gt;Erin Gallant&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DigiGav"&gt;Gavin Kennedy, also from AARNet&lt;/a&gt; about digital
preservation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="picture of the panel" src="http://ptsefton.com/2019/11/07/eResearch_2019/panel.png"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was talking, not taking notes, but we discussed what the research community
and cultural collections folks can learn from each other - actually I think we
made some of the same mistakes, both the eResearch community and GLAM sector
invested in big silos which ended up not just storing data, but making it
difficult to move, re-use. To labour the metaphor a bit, silos have small holes
in the bottom, so getting data in and out is slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike's diagram of an OCFL Repository shows an alternative approach - instead of
putting data in a container with constricted ingress and egress, lay it all out
in the open. I'm not an expert in preservation systems, but I do know that
that's the approach taken by the open source
&lt;a href="https://www.archivematica.org/en/"&gt;Archivematica&lt;/a&gt; preservation system (Note:
I've done a bit of work for Artefactual systems which looks after it), it works
as an application that sits &lt;em&gt;beside&lt;/em&gt; a set of files on disk - if needed you can
use the grandparent of all APIs, that is file operations to fetch data. All of
our talks we gave, linked above, were about this idea in one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Picture of data layed-out and labelled in rows (like a field not a
silo) - by Mike Lynch" src="http://ptsefton.com/2019/11/07/eResearch_2019/field.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Trusted Repository certification - one for the UTS Roadmap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I (Peter again) attended
&lt;a href="https://conference.eresearch.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019_eResearch_106_Trusted-Data-Community.pdf"&gt;a session MCed by Richard Ferrers&lt;/a&gt;
from ARDC with contributions from people from a range of institutions and
repositories who are part of an ARDC community of practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They talked about the Core Trust Seal repository certification program - and the process of getting certified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's some background on CTS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Core Certification and its Benefits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays certification standards are available at different levels, from a core level to extended and formal
levels. Even at the core level, certification offers many benefits to a repository and its stakeholders.
Core certification involves a minimally intensive process whereby data repositories supply evidence that they
are sustainable and trustworthy. A repository first conducts an internal self-assessment, which is then
reviewed by community peers. Such assessments help data communities—producers, repositories, and
consumers—to improve the quality and transparency of their processes, and to increase awareness of and
compliance with established standards. This community approach guarantees an inclusive atmosphere in
which the candidate repository and the reviewers closely interact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to external benefits, such as building stakeholder confidence, enhancing the reputation of the
repository, and demonstrating that the repository is following good practices, core certification provides a
number of internal benefits to a repository. Specifically, core certification offers a benchmark for comparison
and helps to determine the strengths and weaknesses of a repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now at UTS we're in the process of making a new Digital Strategy, aligned the &lt;a href="https://www.uts.edu.au/about/uts-2027-strategy"&gt;UTS 2027 Strategy&lt;/a&gt; - one of the core goals (which are still evolving so we can't link to them just yet) is to have trusted systems. CTS would be a great way for the IT Department (that's us) to demonstrate to the organisation that we have the governance, technology and operational model in place to run a repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're talking now about getting at least the first step (self certification) on the 2021 Roadmap - but before that, we'll see if we can join the community discussion and start planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project is about building highly scalable research data repositories quickly, cheaply and above all sustainably by using Standards for organizing and describing data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a grant to continue our OCFL work from the &lt;a href="https://ror.org/038sjwq14"&gt;Australian Research Data Commons&lt;/a&gt;. (I’ve used the new Research Organisation Registry (ROR) ID for ARDC, just because it’s new and you should all check out the ROR).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;OCFL Specifications&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This Oxford Common File Layout (OCFL) specification describes an application-independent approach to the storage of digital information in a structured, transparent, and predictable manner. It is designed to promote long-term object management best practices within digital repositories.
Specifically, the benefits of the OCFL include:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Completeness, so that a repository can be rebuilt from the files it stores&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parsability, both by humans and machines, to ensure content can be understood in the absence of original software&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robustness against errors, corruption, and migration between storage technologies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Versioning, so repositories can make changes to objects allowing their history to persist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Storage diversity, to ensure content can be stored on diverse storage infrastructures including conventional filesystems and cloud object stores&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a screenshot of what an OCFL object looks like - it’s a series of versioned directories, each with a detailed inventory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the standards we are using is RO-Crate - for describing research data sets. I presented this at eResearch as well [TODO - link]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an example of an RO-Crate showing that each Crate has a human-readable HTML view as well as a machine readable view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two views (human and machine) of the data are equivalent - in fact the HTML version is generated from the JSON-LD version using a tool called &lt;a href="https://code.research.uts.edu.au/eresearch/CalcyteJS"&gt;CalcyteJS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Each of the participants has been indexed for discovery. In a more deployment for a institutional repository, datasets would be indexed at the top level only. The point is to show that this software will be highly configurable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OCFL needs some explaining. I’ve had a couple of conversations with developers
where it takes them a little while to get what it’s for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solr is an efficient search engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nginx is an industry-standard scalable web server, used by companies like DropBox and Netflix&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both are standard, open-source, easy to deploy and keep patched: unlike dedicated data repositories, which tend be fussy and make your server team swear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mapping incoming URLs to the right file in the ocfl repository is straightforward and done with an extension in nginx’s minimal flavour of JavaScript. This slide simplifies things a bit: in real life we have URL ids which solr maps to OIDs and then to a pairtree path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Todo: we want to use the &lt;a href="http://mementoweb.org/guide/howto/"&gt;Memento standard&lt;/a&gt; so that clients can request versioned rsources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are also looking at versioned DOIs pointing to versioned URLs and resources&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The codebase is in a lot of places but that’s consistent with the approach - they are all just components which we can deploy as we need them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nginx extension is very small and would be easy to reimplement against another server&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the most prototypical / primitive part of what we’ve got so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Licences on RO-Crate are indexed in the solr index. nginx authenticates web users, looks up which licences they can access, and applies access control to both search results and payloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, we’ve got a test server which doesn’t authenticate but which only serves datasets with a public licence and denies access to everything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good data standards make incremental development much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were able to get real results in one- and two-day workshops with teams from PARADISEC and the State Library of New South Wales, both with large, structured digital humanities collections behind APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the OCLF and RO-Crate standards are new and changing, but agile development means that it’s OK and even productive to keep pace with this and feed back into community consultation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last couple of months Marco La Rosa, an independent developer working for PARADISEC, has ported 10,000 data and collection items into RO-Crate format, AND built a portal which can display them. This means that ANY repository with a similar structure Items in Collections could easily re-use the code and the viewers for various file types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

We spend a day at the State Library and were able to successfully extract books into directories of JPEGs and metadata, package these using RO-Crate and start building an OCFL repository.&lt;/p&gt;

While our DataCrate work was driven by practical concerns and a desire to describe research data with high-quality metadata Research Object shared those concerns but with more of a focus on reproducibility and detailed provenance for research data.&lt;/p&gt;

RO-Crate is the marriage of &lt;a href="https://www.researchobject.org/"&gt;Research Objects&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://github.com/UTS-eResearch/datacrate"&gt;DataCrate&lt;/a&gt;. It aims to build on their respective strengths, but also to draw on lessons learned from those projects and similar research data packaging efforts. For more details, see &lt;a href="https://researchobject.github.io/ro-crate/background.html"&gt;background&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Who is it for?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RO-Crate effort brings together practitioners from very different backgrounds, and with different motivations and use-cases. Among our core target users are: a) research engaged with computation and data-intensive, wokflow-driven analysis; b) digital repository managers and infrastructure providers; c) individual researchers looking for a straight-forward tool or how-to guide to “FAIRify” their data; d) data stewards supporting research projects in creating and curating datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RO-Crate is a collaboration between people all over the world, but the Editors are from Cork, Manchester and Katoomba
Version one of the standard will be out in by Summer.
But which summer? Standard reference points are important. Standards are important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings us the benefits of Standards. Without this standardised date format chaos would reign. What if that date had been written 05/08 or 08/05 - someone might end up eating food from May in August, or worse, eating last August’s food in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, If you find a partner who’ll adopt the ISO 8601 data standard then ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In RO-Crate - there’s an HTML page which ships with each dataset that allows you to browse the object in as much detail as the author described it and we are careful to avoid ambiguity by adding help links to each metadata term so you see the definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RO-Crates ship with two files, a human readable one and a machine readable JSON file. The two views (human and machine) of the data are equivalent - in fact the HTML version is generated from the JSON-LD version, via the DataCrate nodejs library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'&gt;

&lt;p&gt;' border='1'  width='85%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here’s an automatically generated diagram extracted from the sample DataCrate showing how two images were created. The first result was an image file taken by me (as an agent) using two instruments (my camera and lens), of a place (the object: Catalina park in Katoomba). A sepia toned version was the result of a CreateAction, with the instrument this time being the ImageMagick software. The DataCrate also &lt;a href="https://data.research.uts.edu.au/examples/v1.0/sample/CATALOG_files/5ddf53df/4d0b61c3/d4172208/d5c24816/bad69891/index.html"&gt;contains information&lt;/a&gt; about that CreateAction such as the command used to do the conversion and the version of the software-as-instrument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;convert -sepia-tone 80% test_data/sample/pics/2017-06-11\ 12.56.14.jpg test_data/sample/pics/sepia_fence.jpg&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This way of representing file provenance is Action-centred - the focus is on the action that creates a file, rather than the more usual metadata approach of having the file at the centre with properties for “Author” and the like. The action-based approach is MUCH more flexible as it can model the contribution of multiple agents and instruments separately at the expense of being somewhat counter-intuitive to those of us who are used to a library-card approach to metadata where the work is at the centre and has simple properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a question after this presentation about whether I had the arrows in this diagram pointing in the right direction. Yes, I do! The convention here is the standard way of representing a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_triple"&gt;subject-predicate-object semantic triple&lt;/a&gt; with the subject as the source of the arrow, the predicate (in this case Schem.org property) as a label, and the pointy end pointing at the object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re working on ways to &lt;a href="https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate/issues/27"&gt;describe not just files, but the CONTENTS of files&lt;/a&gt; - using properties like &lt;a href="https://schema.org/variableMeasured"&gt;variableMeasured&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breakig news: In the last couple of months Marco La Rosa, an independent developer working for PARADISEC, has ported 10,000 data and collection items into RO-Crate format, AND built a portal which can display them. This means that ANY repository with a similar structure Items in Collections could easily re-use the code and the viewers for various file types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The .eaf files in the previous example are produced using ELAN software. Marco has done the groundwork for a system that could work across multiple repositories and for stand-alone RO-Crates - the crate metadata describes the files, and what format they’re in, and the viewer which is an HTML page either served by a repository or possibly just off your hard disk, can use that information to load an appropriate viewer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RO-Crate will be released in version 1 in November 2019 - we were aiming for
October, but missed that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will publish the parts that are well-tested and stable, and immediately start
on a new version with bleeding-edge cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want input from potential users, current and prospective implementers and
help drafting new parts of the spec is welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eoghan, Stian and I ran a workshop at OR2019 for repository people to talk about the state of the art in Research Data Packaging, and collect use cases - we got lots of useful input from the workshop and the broader conference and had a chance to chat with people working on related standards such as the Oxford Common File Layout (&lt;a href="https://ocfl.io/"&gt;OCFL&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href="https://swordapp.github.io/swordv3/technical-outline.html"&gt;Sword 3&lt;/a&gt; - Neil Jeffries, Andrew Woods, Simeon Warner and my old mate Richard Jones amongst others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also &lt;a href="/2019/07/01/OCLF.htm"&gt;presented work that Mike Lynch, Moises Sacal and I have been doing on OCFL&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DataCrate is a ​specification​ for packaging research data for dissemination and reuse which has been presented at OR before as it developed to its current v1.0 status. This is an update on progress with the specification and tooling. The goals are of the specification are, (a) to maximise the utility of the data for researchers (including the original researchers' 'future selves') - given that a researcher has found a DataCrate package they should be able to tell what it is, how the data may be used and what all the files contain, (b) to enable discovery of the data by exposing metadata as widely as possible to both humans and machines and (c) to enable automated ingest into repositories or catalogues.
DataCrate can express detailed information about which people, instruments and software were involved in capturing or creating data, where they did it and why, as well as how to cite a dataset.
DataCrate draws on other standards (BagIt, JSON-LD, Schema.org) and is designed to be easy to implement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I proposed this update there had been some work going on to merge DataCrate with another standard - Research Object - but we didn’t know what form that would take. This presentation will now let the love-stuck cat out of the bag. I’m going to tell you a love story about two standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story is about DataCrate - which is a Specification for describing and distributing data (any data).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href="http://www.researchobject.org/"&gt;Research Object&lt;/a&gt; which is also about data packaging but with more emphasis on having a major impact on scholarly communications and practice, including distributing research data with code and workflows in the interests of making it more reproducible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s going to be a marriage of these two standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But before we talk about the upcoming marriage of two specifications, let’s go back over what we’re trying to achieve. I will use examples from DataCrate but the same principles apply with Research Object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a slide from the workshop we ran at the OR conference, setting out some of the functional requirements for a distribution format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a screenshot from a sample DataCrate.  It shows the basic metadata for the dataset. This example is online, but the same view is available if you download it as a zip file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do download the zip then you’ll see these files - the payload data is/are in the &lt;code&gt;/data&lt;/code&gt; directory and the other files are all metadata and fixity checking information. A human can open CATALOG.html and then click around a little website that describes the data, including information down to the file level and about the contents of files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s also machine readable data in JSON-LD format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'&gt;
&lt;img src='http://ptsefton.com/2019/07/01/DataCrate-OR2019/Slide11.png' alt='
&lt;p&gt;' title='&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;' border='1'  width='85%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JSON-LD is designed to be easily consumed by programs that can do things with the data - and is compatible ith Google’s DataSet search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two views (human and machine) of the data are equivalent - in fact the HTML version is generated from the JSON-LD version using a tool called &lt;a href="https://code.research.uts.edu.au/eresearch/CalcyteJS"&gt;CalcyteJS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;' border='1'  width='85%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a screenshot of an HTML page about one of the files in the sample dataset - including detailed EXIF technical metdata which from INSIDE the file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here’s an automatically generated diagram extracted from the sample DataCrate showing how two images were created. The first result was an image file taken by me (as an agent) using two instruments (my camera and lens), of a place (the object: Catalina park in Katoomba). A sepia toned version was the result of a CreateAction, with the instrument this time being the ImageMagick software. The DataCrate also &lt;a href="https://data.research.uts.edu.au/examples/v1.0/sample/CATALOG_files/5ddf53df/4d0b61c3/d4172208/d5c24816/bad69891/index.html"&gt;contains information&lt;/a&gt; about that CreateAction such as the command used to do the conversion and the version of the software-as-instrument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;convert -sepia-tone 80% test_data/sample/pics/2017-06-11\ 12.56.14.jpg test_data/sample/pics/sepia_fence.jpg&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;' border='1'  width='85%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because DataCrate is based on JSON-LD, and linked data principles, each term used can have a link to its definition, eg: &lt;a href="https://schema.org/CreateAction"&gt;https://schema.org/CreateAction&lt;/a&gt; so DataCrates are self-documenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;' border='1'  width='85%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BUT. tools for humans to generate linked-data are under-developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JSON-LD tooling is limited to high-level transformations and there are no easily available libraries for  Research Software Engineers to do simple stuff like traversing graphs or looking up context keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linked data is still too much like rocket science because of all the architecture astronauts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2001/04/21/dont-let-architecture-astronauts-scare-you/"&gt;Joel Splosky&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the people I call Architecture Astronauts. It’s very hard to get them to write code or design programs, because they won’t stop thinking about Architecture. They’re astronauts because they are above the oxygen level, I don’t know how they’re breathing. They tend to work for really big companies that can afford to have lots of unproductive people with really advanced degrees that don’t contribute to the bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, as with many technologies, RDF can be a bit of a religious matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members of the OR-Crate project (anyone can join by following the directions at the repo) are reviewing the spec - which is based on a set of examples - and we expect to have a simplified, clearer specification draft by the end of July, and to launch an Alpha version in October at &lt;a href="https://conference.eresearch.edu.au/"&gt;eResearch Australasia&lt;/a&gt; (subject to getting  presentation accepted :).&lt;/p&gt;

How does RO-Crate work with BagIt, OCFL, Zip et al
How can I re-run this analysis? Via a workflow?
How can I do stuff with this dataset?

&lt;p&gt;This presentation will look at how a Metadata Standard - RO-Crate - with Metadata Profile (the Language Data Commons) is being developed and implemented. Two major collections are collaborating on the standard, PARADISEC and the Language Data Commons of Australia (LDaCA). This ongoing standardisation effort for language data is designed to improve interoperability, reduce costs for data migration and allow storage on disk, object storage or in archival repositories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/"&gt;RO-Crate&lt;/a&gt; is a linked-data metadata system which allows discovery metadata (Who, what where) based on the widely adopted Schema.org vocabulary to be seamlessly integrated with more discipline specific metadata. RO-Crate uses metadata profiles to provide guidance for packaging resources for particular disciplines and purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation we will introduce a RO-Crate metadata profile for language data which extends the core RO-Crate standard with new vocabulary terms adapted from pre-linked-data discipline specific metadata efforts, particularly the Open Language Archives Community (OLAC) standards. The profile has English-language guidance on how to structure collections of resources in a repository with links between them, such that they can be indexed and displayed via APIs and search/browse portals. The profile is also implemented as a series of machine-readable profiles for the Describo Online metadata description system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will demonstrate current ways of describing items in a variety of languages and modes (spoken, written and signed), from a large set of heterogeneous language resources held by PARADISEC and LDaCA. We will also show how to access them via API calls and a search portal, and how resources may be stored in simple storage systems using the Arkisto platform (a set of standards and principles).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Language Data Commons of Australia Data Partnerships (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.47486/HIR001"&gt;LDaCA&lt;/a&gt;) and the Australian Text Analytics Platform (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.47486/PL074"&gt;ATAP&lt;/a&gt;) are building towards a scalable and flexible language data and analytics commons. These projects will be part of the Humanities and Social Sciences Research Data Commons (HASS RDC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Data Commons will focus on preservation and discovery of distributed multi-modal language data collections under a variety of governance frameworks. This will include access control that reflects ethical constraints and intellectual property rights, including those of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander, migrant and Pacific communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The platform will provide workbench services to support computational research, starting with code-notebooks with no-code research tools provided in later phases. Research artefacts such as code and derived data will be made available as fully documented research objects that are re-runnable and rigorously described. Metrics to demonstrate the impact of the platform are projected to include usage statistics, data and article citations. These projects are led by Professor Michael Haugh of the School of Languages and Culture at the University of Queensland with several partner institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PARADISEC (the Pacific And Regional Archive for Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures) is a digital archive of records of some of the many small cultures and languages of the world and it has developed models to ensure that the archive can provide access to interested communities while also conforming with emerging international standards for digital archiving. Australian researchers have been making unique and irreplaceable audiovisual recordings in the region since portable field recorders became available in the mid-twentieth century, yet until the establishment of PARADISEC there was no Australian repository for these invaluable research recordings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goal: Be able to store data with an eye on preservation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an archive like PARADISEC - it is important to be be able to maintain resources over the long term. For example, much material which falls within the scope of PARADISEC is stored on legacy media. PARADISEC archives tapes from a range of sources, such as the agencies in the Pacific shown in the images above. Such material needs to be digitised and returned to the source with meaningful metadata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;img src='https://ptsefton.com/2022/11/25/ldaca-metadata-ecosystem-eresearch-2022/Slide05.png' alt='PARADISEC ACCESS  https://language-archives.services/about/data-loader ' title='Slide: 5' border='1'  width='85%%'/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PARADISEC has learned the importance of making the collection self-describing so it is not dependent on a database as the sole metadata source. It does use a database for administrative services, from which a text file with metadata for any item can be exported. This allows us to select an arbitrary set of items, put them on a hard disk, and use the dataloader application to generate an html catalog of just those items, drawing on the internal metadata file describing each item. This can be delivered on a hard disk to a local community or cultural organisation, or on a raspberry pi wifi local network to allow access on phones, as seen here in Erakor village in central Vanuatu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example of how good metadata practice can improve community access is the Auslan (Australian Sign Language) corpus, for which community access is very important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Auslan Corpus has been stored with the Endangered Languages Archive (&lt;a href="https://www.elararchive.org/"&gt;ELAR&lt;/a&gt;) since 2008. However, ELAR does not currently suit the access needs of the Auslan corpus; it has low discoverability, and files must be downloaded individually. The corpus, along with the Auslan SignBank dictionary, is being included in LDaCA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Auslan Corpus holds great value as an educational tool for Auslan users and learners, both Deaf and hearing, and the move to LDaCA will allow further development of educational tools. One such tool is the ability, still under development, for Auslan Signbank dictionary to pull real-world examples of signs out of the corpus to show alongside dictionary entries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;img src='https://ptsefton.com/2022/11/25/ldaca-metadata-ecosystem-eresearch-2022/Slide07.png' alt='' title='Slide: 7' border='1'  width='85%%'/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all of the collections we are working with data is discoverable via some kind of web portal which indexes and displays the archive (repository) of data. These screenshots are of work in progress at LDaCA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The LDaCA services we are building use an API to drive the data portals. The API can be used for direct access with appropriate access control – see &lt;a href="posts/fair-care-eresearch-2022"&gt;another eResearch presentation&lt;/a&gt; which explains this in detail. These screenshots show code notebooks (running in BinderHub on the Nectar cloud) accessing language resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having looked at the user-facing products, websites and APIs, we turn our attention to how data is managed on disk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the PARADISEC system this is achieved by storing files on disk in a simple hierarchy - with metadata and other resources stored together in a directory - this scheme allows for hands-on management of data resources, independently of the software used to serve them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach means that if the PARADISEC software-stack becomes un-maintainable for financial or technical reasons the important resources, the data, are stored safely on disk with their metadata and a new access portal could be constructed relatively easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the valuable features of this solution, it is not generalisable. The metadata.xml is custom to PARADISEC, as is the software stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2019 PARADISEC and the eResearch team at UTS received small grants from the Australian National Data Service and began collaborating on an approach to managing archival repositories which built on this PARADISEC approach of storing metadata with data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UTS team presented on this at &lt;a href="https://ptsefton.com/2019/11/05/FAIR%20Repo%20-%20eResearch%20Presentation/index.html"&gt;eResearch Australasia 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this Research Data Commons work we are using the Arkisto Platform (introduced &lt;a href="http://ptsefton.com/2020/11/23/Arkisto/index.html"&gt;at eResearch 2020&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arkisto aims to ensure the long term preservation of data independently of code and services, recognizing the ephemeral nature of software and platforms. We know that sustaining software platforms can be hard and aim to make sure that important data assets are not locked up in databases or hard-coded logic of some hard-to-maintain application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by PARADISEC’s approach the Arkisto platform is based on the idea of storing data in simple easy to manage file or object storage systems with metadata in an easily readable standard format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LDaCA repositories use the Oxford Common File Layout (&lt;a href="https://ocfl.io/"&gt;OCFL&lt;/a&gt;) standard which is backed and used by a number of universities and has multiple implementations while PARADISEC data will be migrated to a simpler data storage approach &lt;a href="https://github.com/CoEDL/nocfl-js"&gt;NOCFL&lt;/a&gt;, which is a single-library implementation, inspired by some of the same aims, but with different implementation choices to avoid data being obfuscated by OCFL’s layout, which is a product of its commitment to immutable, write-once file management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now to the main focus of this presentation - the metadata “Profile” we are jointly developing to ensure that language resources can be described in a way that is interoperable between software, and re-usable over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Profile is an “RO-Crate Profile”, a kind of Cook Book for how to describe and package language data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RO-Crate is method for describing a dataset as a digital object using a &lt;strong&gt;single linked-data metadata document&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dataset may contain any kind of data resource about anything, in any format as a file or URL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RO-Crate standard also strongly recommends that JSON metadata is supplemented with an HTML preview - above we show what that looks like for a PARADISEC item. This is a screenshot of an HTML view of a PARADISEC Item generated using &lt;a href="https://github.com/UTS-eResearch/ro-crate-html-js"&gt;an HTML rendering tool for RO-Crate&lt;/a&gt;. The important point here is that this is a &lt;em&gt;generic&lt;/em&gt; viewer that can understand any RO-Crate. It may not be glamorous but it could be included in an archive as a way to provide human-readable access in the absence of portals that are data specific (but cost money to build and maintain).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'&gt;
&lt;img src='https://ptsefton.com/2022/11/25/ldaca-metadata-ecosystem-eresearch-2022/Slide15.png' alt=' https://mod.paradisec.org.au ' title='Slide: 15' border='1'  width='85%%'/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the same page from the previous slide seen in a working model of an RO-Crate set exported from the current PARADISEC catalog, with a single page viewer using an elastic search. The two pages shown here are generated directly from metadata that was stored in an RO-Crate in a storage system using PARADISEC specific, rather than generic code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'&gt;
&lt;img src='https://ptsefton.com/2022/11/25/ldaca-metadata-ecosystem-eresearch-2022/Slide16.png' alt='  ' title='Slide: 16' border='1'  width='85%%'/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/structure.html"&gt;structure of an RO-Crate&lt;/a&gt; is very similar to the PARADISEC example above, but with a json file instead of XML, and an optional preview in HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RO-Crate has a growing number of &lt;a href="https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/tools/"&gt;tools and software libraries&lt;/a&gt; which means that a team such as PARADISEC do not have to maintain their own bespoke software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'&gt;
&lt;img src='https://ptsefton.com/2022/11/25/ldaca-metadata-ecosystem-eresearch-2022/Slide17.png' alt=' ' title='Slide: 17' border='1'  width='85%%'/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The base vocabulary for the JSON-LD used in RO-Crate is schema.org - a widely used linked data standard. RO-Crate uses a handful of terms from other ontologies but importantly it allows for seamless extensibility with domain specific vocabularies, which is what we will talk about next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'&gt;
&lt;img src='https://ptsefton.com/2022/11/25/ldaca-metadata-ecosystem-eresearch-2022/Slide18.png' alt='  ' title='Slide: 18' border='1'  width='85%%'/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PARADISEC metadata model is based on the Open Language Archives (OLAC) metadata standard. This is an XML based standard, but has good online documentation, which is perfect for migrating to a Linked Data approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used the OLAC terms, including &lt;a href="http://www.language-archives.org/REC/type-20020628.html"&gt;some that were proposed but withdrawn&lt;/a&gt; as the basis for a new vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of a LIEF project (2022-23, led by author Thieberger), revisions to the OLAC scheme are planned, together with rebuilding the OLAC metadata harvester and aggregator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new Langauge Data Terms have been published at &lt;a href="https://purl.archive.org/language-data-commons/terms"&gt;https://purl.archive.org/language-data-commons/terms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These terms have been modernised and mainstreamed from previous ways of describing resources, for example instead of describing the main item of interest as a PrimaryText (where text is any kind of communicative resource – not a bitstream of characters) we use the term PrimaryResource. And in the example in the image, the type of genre &lt;em&gt;Informational&lt;/em&gt; has been added to the set proposed in the OLAC vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we come back in detail to how RO-Crate works we will discuss the structure or skeleton of our language collections stored in a repository&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'&gt;
&lt;img src='https://ptsefton.com/2022/11/25/ldaca-metadata-ecosystem-eresearch-2022/Slide21.png' alt=' ' title='Slide: 21' border='1'  width='85%%'/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadly speaking there are two ways that an Arkisto-style repository can be structured and the profile sets out criteria for choosing one of the options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For small, stable collections of data an entire collection (often referred to a ‘corpus’ by linguists) can be stored in a single directory or directory-like structure in an object store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'&gt;
&lt;img src='https://ptsefton.com/2022/11/25/ldaca-metadata-ecosystem-eresearch-2022/Slide22.png' alt='  ' title='Slide: 22' border='1'  width='85%%'/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For larger collections the approach used by PARADISEC and most LDaCA collections is to store each Object or Item (typically a related set of recordings, or a single document) in a directory (or directory-like thing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this mode, each Object MUST link back to the Collection Object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Collection Object MAY have explicit listing of hasMember properties - which makes it possible to construct repository navigation (such as websites) more cheaply. This is the approach used in PARADISEC, while in LDaCA these links are constructed by an indexer servicer or summarizer application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the data is described, we ingest it into a repository, as a set of files on disk or object storage and index it in a portal, as you can see in these screenshots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation we have shown the major components of an ecosystem for storing, discovering and analysing language data using common standards for describing objects in a repository. The &lt;a href="https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/"&gt;RO-Crate&lt;/a&gt; standard is used as the key metadata container, with a common vocabulary of language specific terms for describing data. This approach should reduce development costs and increase data reuse. The approach can also be adapted to other disciplines and domains with the development only of new profiles..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Language Data Commons of Australia Data Partnerships (LDaCA) and the Australian Text Analytics Platform (ATAP) are building towards a scalable and flexible language data and analytics commons. These projects will be part of the Humanities and Social Sciences Research Data Commons (HASS RDC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Data Commons will focus on preservation and discovery of distributed multi-modal language data collections under a variety of governance frameworks. This will include access control that reflects ethical constraints and intellectual property rights, including those of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander, migrant and Pacific communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The platform will provide workbench services to support computational research, starting with code-notebooks with no-code research tools provided in later phases. Research artefacts such as code and derived data will be made available as fully documented research objects that are re-runnable and rigorously described. Metrics to demonstrate the impact of the platform are projected to include usage statistics, data and article citations. These projects are led by Professor Michael Haugh of the School of Languages and Culture at the University of Queensland with several partner institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year at eResearch Australasia, the Language Data Commons of Australia (LDaCA) team presented a design for a distributed access control system which could look after the A-is-for-accessible in FAIR data; in this presentation we describe and demonstrate a pilot system based on that design, showing how data licenses that allow access by identified groups of people to language data collections can be used with an AAF pilot system (CILogon) to give the right people access to data resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ARDC have invested in a pilot of this work as part of the HASS Research Data Commons and Indigenous Research Capability Program integration activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system has to be able to implement data access policies with real-world complexity and one of our challenges has been developing a data access policy that works across a range of different collections of language data. Here we present a pilot data access policy that we have developed, describing how this policy captures the decisions that must be made by a range of data providers to ensure data accessibility that complies with diverse legal, moral and ethical considerations.
We will discuss how the &lt;a href="https://www.gida-global.org/care"&gt;CARE&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618"&gt;FAIR&lt;/a&gt; principles underpin this work, and compare this work to other projects such as &lt;a href="https://ardc.edu.au/project/cadre/"&gt;CADRE&lt;/a&gt;, which promise to deliver more complex solutions in the future. Initial work is with collections curated in a research context but we will also address community access to these resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is to separate safe storage of data from its delivery. Each item in a repository is stored with licensing information in natural language (English at the moment, but could be other languages) and the repository defers access decisions to an Authorization system, where data custodians can design whatever process they like for granting license access. This can range from simple click-through licenses where anyone can agree to license terms, to detailed multi-step workflows where applicants are vetted based on whatever criteria the rights holder wishes; qualifications, membership of a cultural group, have they paid a subscription fee, etc&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="Slide04.png" alt="alt text" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding rights, our project is informed by the &lt;a href="https://www.gida-global.org/care"&gt;CARE&lt;/a&gt; principles for Indigenous data which also describe the level of respect which should be given to any data collected from individuals or communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current movement toward open data and open science does not fully engage with Indigenous Peoples rights and interests. Existing principles within the open data movement (e.g. FAIR: findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) primarily focus on characteristics of data that will facilitate increased data sharing among entities while ignoring power differentials and historical contexts. The emphasis on greater data sharing alone creates a tension for Indigenous Peoples who are also asserting greater control over the application and use of Indigenous data and Indigenous Knowledge for collective benefit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are designing the system so that it can work with diverse ways of expressing access rights, for example we are considering how the approach described here could be extended based on the likes of the &lt;a href="https://localcontexts.org/labels/traditional-knowledge-labels/"&gt;Tribal Knowledge labels&lt;/a&gt;, incorporating them into the data licensing framework we discuss below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk we look at a case-study with the &lt;a href="https://slll.cass.anu.edu.au/sydney-speaks"&gt;Sydney Speaks project&lt;/a&gt; via LDaCA steering committee member Professor &lt;a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1410-3268"&gt;Catherine Travis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project seeks to document and explore Australian English, as spoken in Australia’s largest and most ethnically and linguistically diverse city – Sydney.
The title “Sydney Speaks” captures a key defining feature of the project: the data come from recorded conversations between Sydney siders, as they tell stories about their lives and experiences, their opinions and attitudes. This allows us to measure how their lived experiences impact their speech patterns.
Working within the framework of variationist sociolinguistics, we examine variation in phonetics, grammar and discourse, in an effort to answer questions of fundamental interest both to Australian English, and language variation and change more broadly, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How has Australian English as spoken in Sydney changed over the past 100 years?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has the change in the ethnic diversity over that time period (and in particular, over the past 40 years) had any impact on the way Australian English is spoken?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What affects the way variation and change spread through society - Who are the initiators and who are the leaders in change? - How do social networks function in a modern metropolis? - What social factors are relevant to Sydney speech today, and over time (gender? class? region? ethnic identity?)
A better understanding of what kind of variation exists in Australian English, and of how and why Australian English has changed over time can help society be more accepting of speech variation and even help address prejudices based on ways of speaking.

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collection contains recordings of people speaking, both contemporary and historic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because this involved human participants there are restrictions on the distribution of data - a situation we see with lots of studies involving people in a huge range of disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are four tiers of data access we need to enforce and observe for this data based on the participant agreements and ethics arrangements under which the data were collected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concerns about rights and interests are important for any data involving people - and a large amount the data both indigenous and non-indigenous we are using will require access control that ensures that data is shared with the right users under the right conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets go over some basics, starting with &lt;em&gt;licences&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A licence in this context is &lt;em&gt;a natural language document&lt;/em&gt; in which a copyright holder sets out the terms and conditions of use for data. Licences &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; have metadata that describes them, eg a property to say that this is an open licence (and does not require a check when serving data).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A license is not a computer program, or configuration, or an AI entity that can make decisions, it’s a legal document. You may also know this as a “data sharing agreement” or “terms of use”. Examples of licenses we see all the time are the GNU GPL or the various Creative Commons licenses which grant rights to others to redistribute a creative work, and specifies conditions on what changes are permitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, metadata &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; a license can be used to automate decision making - if it is labelled as being an open license, then a repository can serve data and include that data, if it is labeled as “closed” or more aptly, “authorization-required” then repository software can perform an authorization step, which we cover in detail later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the world of research data generated by or about human participants, licenses can’t always allow unauthenticated access and data redistribution, and they may permit distribution only to certain people, or classes or person. Some data, for example (particularly that which has not been or cannot be de-identified) can only be made available to the original research team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="Slide09.png" alt="alt text" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'&gt;
&lt;img src='https://ptsefton.com/2022/11/16/fair-care-eresearch-2022/Slide09.png' alt='  ' title='Slide: 9' border='1'  width='85%%'/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Dall-e prompt : A sad dog sitting on an iceberg, XKCD)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, a license is a document that expresses conditions such as “Data can be used by other researchers”, but unfortunately we don’t have systems in the research-data ecosystem which can automatically identify a user as “a researcher” (this may be surprising to some, but the Australian Access Federation can, at this stage, only say that someone has an account with an institution - it can’t tell a professor from a student administration officer and there are certainly no lists of “certified linguists”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some cold hard facts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t have an authority that can identify someone as a researcher,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or a “linguist”,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or an “anthropologist”,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or a member of an ARC (Australian Research Council) research project,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://ardc.edu.au/project/cadre/"&gt;CADRE&lt;/a&gt; project is working on systems that will eventually support all these things, but they are not available as services yet, and their initial focus is on government data, so we have to work out ways for our data custodians to make decisions on who is considered an “other researcher” in the absence of attribute-based authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="Slide10.png" alt="alt text" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'&gt;
&lt;img src='https://ptsefton.com/2022/11/16/fair-care-eresearch-2022/Slide10.png' alt='' title='Slide: 10' border='1'  width='85%%'/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The access control system we have been prototyping is based on licenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For any data object, which could be an entire collection, or one set of recordings of a speaker in a speech study, or a set of hand written linguistic field notes from the 1950s, or a novel etc we store a license with it. This means that future archivists / librarians and researchers can work out how to manage the data if the systems we build today for automated access are no longer operational and we give the license an ID which is a URL we can use to identify it uniquely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This diagram shows how a license is explicitly linked to the data using a metadata description standard known as “Research Object Crate” &lt;a href="http://ptsefton.com/2019/11/05/RO-Crate%20eResearch%20Australasia%202019/index.html"&gt;RO-Crate&lt;/a&gt; . Each object in the repository is a crate, with a metadata file that describes the object and (optionally) its component files, including the data license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="Slide11.png" alt="alt text" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This diagram has been updated from the one presented at eResearch to show two portals instead of one)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every item in a repository has a license, which may be an open one like CC Share Alike or a custom license derived from the ethics and participants agreements for a study in the context of local laws and institutional policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this license, distributed access portals in our architecture can check against an authorization system for each request for data. The portals may both host data with the same licensing but do not need to maintain access control lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="Slide12.png" alt="alt text" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Images: Various baskets of puppies by DALL-E)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we first developed access controls for LDaCA in 2021 it was a requirement that data licensing and access control decisions be decoupled from each other, and from particular repository software. The usual approach in repositories is to build in a local access-control system, but this is tied to a particular implementation and will not work in a distributed environment where there are multiple different repositories, and services such as computational resources that researchers need to access to process data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could not find an available open source system for managing license-based access to data, so our starting approach used groups as a proxy for granting licences on that basis that all common user-directory services such as LDAP include the concept of user groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scope:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;simplest possible license based approach to access control&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOT attempting to be attribute based as that is not currently feasible within our project scope (see &lt;a href="https://ardc.edu.au/project/cadre/"&gt;CADRE&lt;/a&gt; for progress in that direction)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="Slide13.png" alt="alt text" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'&gt;
&lt;img src='https://ptsefton.com/2022/11/16/fair-care-eresearch-2022/Slide13.png' alt='' title='Slide: 13' border='1'  width='85%%'/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first prototype, which we presented at eResearch Australasia last year was a proof-of-concept Github based system. This demonstrated that authorization can be delegated from a repository to an external service. For each of the Sydney Speaks licenses there was a Github group (organization). The repository, when requested to serve data would get the user to login using the Github Authentication services, then check if the user was in the correct license group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This worked, but there were issues with this approach:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no workflow options (unless we build a workflow system), just adding people to a Github organisation to pre-authorize them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system only supported a single logon service, which is not widely used in academia or by community groups&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we talked to the our colleagues at the Australian Access Federation (AAF), about a supported, research-sector-wide service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="Slide14.png" alt="alt text" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'&gt;
&lt;img src='https://ptsefton.com/2022/11/16/fair-care-eresearch-2022/Slide14.png' alt='' title='Slide: 14' border='1'  width='85%%'/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AAF, as it happened were already working with other research groups on a service called &lt;a href="https://www.cilogon.org/"&gt;CILogon&lt;/a&gt; (hosted in the USA initially, but soon to be hosted in Australia), like Github, this service has groups (which was our way of associating users with licenses in the absence of a specific license-granting service), but also allows users to log in with a variety of Authentication providers, including research institutions, via the Australian Access Federation as well as social logins such as Google and Microsoft (and our old friend Github).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again this worked, but the current version of CILogon does not have particularly easy-to-use ways for a license-holder to create groups - there are a number of abstract constructs to deal with and there is currently no way to build an approval workflow using the web interface, so as with the Github trial we would have needed to build this part (all of this may change, as the software is under constant development).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/xEWXiM-jUfY"&gt;nine minute silent video&lt;/a&gt; of what this looked like on YouTube for those who are really interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AAF is engaging with our project on the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a cloud-based authentication and authorisation infrastructure (AAI) to support the needs of the project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;understand and develop business process documentation for authorising access to data and services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;configure the AAI to support these business processes and to develop extensions to facilitate new functionality that may be required&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create a set of policies, standards and guidelines for managing researchers’ identity and access management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;develop support documentation, train community representatives to operate the platform, and provide support to the community managers.
The AAF has recommended CILogon &amp;amp; REMS as potential solutions to investigate &amp;amp; prototype&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CILogon is a federated identity management platform that provides the following features:
support for institutional and community logins
cross-institutional and community collaboration
federated identity and group management
a community management dashboard
OIDC connectors for downstream services that support authorisation claims for services like
REMS
BinderHub
JupyterHub
LDaCA Dashboard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;REMS (Resource Entitlement Management System) is a tool to help researchers browse resources such as datasets relevant to their research and to manage the application process for access to the resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;img src='https://ptsefton.com/2022/11/16/fair-care-eresearch-2022/Slide15.png' alt='REMS ' title='Slide: 15' border='1'  width='85%%'/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently (after the abstract for this presentation was submitted) the AAF team made us aware of the Resource Entitlement Management System, &lt;a href="https://github.com/CSCfi/rems"&gt;REMS&lt;/a&gt;, which is an open source application out of Finland. This software is the missing link for LDaCA in that it allows a data custodian to grant licenses to users. And it works with CILogon as an Authentication layer so we can let users log in using a variety of services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the core of REMS is a set of Licenses which can then be associated with Resources - in our design this is (almost always) a one-to-one correspondence, for example we would have a licence “Sydney Speaks Data Researcher Access License” corresponding to resource that represents ALL data with that licence. These Resources can then be made available through a catalog, and workflows can be set up for pre-authorization processes ranging from single-click authorizations where a user just accepts a licence and a bot approves it, to complex forms where users upload credentials and one or more data custodians approve their request, and grant them the licence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also has features for revoking permissions, and has a full API so admin tasks can be automated (for us that’s in the future).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a user has been granted a license in a pre-authorization process then a repository can authorize access to a resource by checking with REMS to see if a given user is pre-authorized. That is, has been granted a license. Note that users do not have to find REMS on their own - they will be directed to it from data and computing services when they need to apply for pre-authorization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This interaction diagram shows the flow involved in a user applying for a data license via REMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not shown here are some design and preparation steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team read their ethics approval and participant agreements and craft one or more access agreements (AKA licenses) for a data set (NOTE: If the data can be made available automatically with just a license attached, such as when all parties have agreed that data can be Creative commons licensed, or the data is in the public domain then the following steps are not required)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team and support staff add the license to REMS, creating a “resource” a virtual offering that corresponds to any dataset that has the above license&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team add a workflow to REMS - this could range from an auto-approved click through where users can agree to license terms, through to detailed (manual) checking of their credentials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next slide shows the interactions involved in accessing data once a user has been granted the license license.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This diagram shows the “access-control dance” for a user who has been granted a license in REMS obtaining access to a dataset at a data portal which gives access to data in a repository or archive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="Slide19.png" alt="alt text" title="FAQ" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'&gt;
&lt;img src='https://ptsefton.com/2022/11/16/fair-care-eresearch-2022/Slide19.png' alt='FAQ  ' title='Slide: 19' border='1'  width='85%%'/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This section was added after the conference, to try to summarize the discussion and clarify requirements by starting an FAQ on this approach)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Q Why not &amp;quot;just&amp;quot; implement an access control list (ACL) in the repository?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons for the distributed approach we have taken in LDaCA:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACLs need maintenance over time - people's identities change, they retire and die, so storing a list of identifiers such as email addresses alongside content is not a viable long-term preservation strategy. Rather, we will encourage data custodians to describe in words what are permitted uses for the data, and by whom, in a license, then allow whomever is the current data custodian to manage that access in a separate administrative system. We expect these administrative systems to be ephemeral, and change over time but also to generate less friction over time as standards are developed. Expected future benefits of concentrating these processes will include that people do not have to prove the same claims they make about themselves multiple times and that it is easier for data custodians to authorize access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LDaCA data will be stored in a variety of places with separate portal applications serving data for specific purposes; if these systems all have in-built authorization schemes, even if they are the same, then we have the problem of synchronizing access control lists around a network of services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accessing data that requires some sort of authorization process is not language or humanities specific, so working with an existing application that can handle pre-authorization workflows and access-control authorization decisions is an attractive choice and should allow LDaCA to take advantage of centrally managed services with functionality that improves over time rather than having to develop and maintain our own systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If complex access controls are implemented inside a system then there is a risk that data becomes stranded inside that system and cannot be reused without completely re-implementing the access control. For example, imagine an archive of cultural material with complex access controls encoded into the business logic such as “this item is accessible only to male initiates”. Applications like this need to store user accounts with attributes on both data and user records that can be used to authorize access. There is a high risk of data being stranded in a system such as this if it is no longer supported. This will be mitigated somewhat if the rules are also expressed as licenses, perhaps a composition of Traditional Knowledge (TK) Labels - but the access system is baked-in to the application and not portable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Q: Yes but why does data need to have a license if we already have access controls?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point of Research Data Commons projects like LDaCA is to create an ecosystem where data can be re-used. For language data, this means that users, including researchers and community members, will be able to download data for certain authorised purposes and activities. The license is the way that data custodians communicate to data users (and future administrators) what those purposes activities are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A license, which is always packaged with data will allow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A user to inspect a five-year-old dataset in their downloads folder and work out what they are allowed to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An IT professional to clean up laptop that has been handed in by (or seized from – it happens) a departing faculty member.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A developer to re-create an access control replacing a decommissioned system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Q So many licenses! Sounds like a lot of work!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We expect that the overhead of writing licenses will diminish greatly over time and standard clauses and complete licenses will be established. A data depositor will be able to choose from a set of standard license terms (such as a standard “restricted to CIs and participants license” for a given repository, using that as a template to mint their own license for a given data set with its own name and ID. The user can choose a standard way of adding pre-authorized licensees (such as email invitations). This ID can then be used by an authorization system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Q So you have centralized authorization into a system that grants licenses doesn't that mean you are locked-in to that system?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, and Yes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No&lt;/strong&gt;, there is no lock in regarding the list of Licenses and pre-authorized users; licenses and access control lists can be exported via an API so it is possible to import them into another system or save them for audit purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes&lt;/strong&gt;, there is lockin, in that at this stage the workflow used to give access to users is specific to the system (such as REMS)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But&lt;/strong&gt;, because our process requires a governance step &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; in writing a license, then there is a statement of intent for re-building those processes later if needed - a step which is very likely to be missing in a system with built-in access control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, over time, we expect the administrative burden of constructing workflows will become less as standards are developed for a couple of things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Licenses can be made less complex (particularly in the context of academic studies) if they specify re-use by particular known cohorts in advance - this comes down to improving the design of studies to encourage data reuse. This may also help to simplify academic ethics processes in the medium to long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CADRE project is looking to improve pre-authorization workflows that automatically source relevant information about potential users - fetching their publication record, and potentially remembering what certifications they have, so these attributes can be used and reused for decision making. It is conceivable that this approach might be useful in cultural contexts as well to allow data custodians to manage data sharing - this is a discussion we have yet to have in the broader HASS RDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Q What if I have a really simple requirement like giving access to just a couple of people - doesn’t this license approach just add complexity?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a data item needs to be locked down to a small group of people, say the chief investigator and the participants in a recorded dialogue then an obvious implementation is to maintain a small access control list (ACL) for the item. But all of the issues identified above with application-specific ACLs are the same, no matter the size of the cohort: the data set can’t be access controlled outside of its home system. If the system is no longer running then the data may be completely inaccessible, and if there is no license document stored with the data setting out terms of re-use in general terms then there is no indication to future administrators about who, if anyone, should have access of the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Q: We don’t need a license, we have a “terms of use”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same thing. Terms of use for data are what a license does. We are designing our systems so that all the relevant terms and conditions go in one place to minimize confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Language Data Commons of Australia Data Partnerships (LDaCA) and the Australian Text Analytics Platform (ATAP) are establishing a scalable and flexible language data and analytics commons. These projects will be part of the Humanities and Social Sciences Research Data Commons (HASS RDC).
The Data Commons will focus on preservation and discovery of distributed multi-modal language data collections under a variety of governance frameworks. This will include access control that reflects ethical constraints and intellectual property rights, including those of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander, migrant and Pacific communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;' title='Slide: 1' border='1'  width='85%%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this Research Data Commons work we are using the Arkisto Platform (introduced &lt;a href="http://ptsefton.com/2020/11/23/Arkisto/index.html"&gt;at eResearch 2020&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arkisto aims  to secure the long term preservation of data independently of code and services - recognizing the ephemeral nature of software and platforms. We know that sustaining software platforms can be hard and aim to make sure that important data assets are not locked up in database or hard-coded logic of some hard-to-maintain application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are using three key standards on this project …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'&gt;
&lt;img src='https://ptsefton.com/2022/02/18/hass_rdc_tech_advisory/Slide02.png' alt='
&lt;p&gt;' title='Slide: 2' border='1'  width='85%%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first standard is the &lt;a href="https://ocfl.io/1.0/spec/"&gt;Oxford Common File Layout&lt;/a&gt; - this is a way of keeping version controlled digital objects on a plain old filesystem or object store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the introduction to the spec:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section is non-normative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Oxford Common File Layout (OCFL) specification describes an application-independent approach to the storage of digital objects in a structured, transparent, and predictable manner. It is designed to promote long-term access and management of digital objects within digital repositories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Need&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OCFL initiative began as a discussion amongst digital repository practitioners to identify well-defined, common, and application-independent file management for a digital repository's persisted objects and represents a specification of the community’s collective recommendations addressing five primary requirements: completeness, parsability, versioning, robustness, and storage diversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Completeness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OCFL recommends storing metadata and the content it describes together so the OCFL object can be fully understood in the absence of original software. The OCFL does not make recommendations about what constitutes an object, nor does it assume what type of metadata is needed to fully understand the object, recognizing those decisions may differ from one repository to another. However, it is recommended that when making this decision, implementers consider what is necessary to rebuild the objects from the files stored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Parsability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One goal of the OCFL is to ensure objects remain fixed over time. This can be difficult as software and infrastructure change, and content is migrated. To combat this challenge, the OCFL ensures that both humans and machines can understand the layout and corresponding inventory regardless of the software or infrastructure used. This allows for humans to read the layout and corresponding inventory, and understand it without the use of machines. Additionally, if existing software were to become obsolete, the OCFL could easily be understood by a light weight application, even without the full feature repository that might have been used in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Versioning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another need expressed by the community was the need to update and change objects, either the content itself or the metadata associated with the object. The OCFL relies heavily on the prior art in the [Moab] Design for Digital Object Versioning which utilizes forward deltas to track the history of the object. Utilizing this schema allows implementers of the OCFL to easily recreate past versions of an OCFL object. Like with objects, the OCFL remains silent on when versioning should occur recognizing this may differ from implementation to implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Robustness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OCFL also fills the need for robustness against errors, corruption, and migration. The versioning schema ensures an OCFL object is robust enough to allow for the discovery of human errors. The fixity checking built into the OCFL via content addressable storage allows implementers to identify file corruption that might happen outside of normal human interactions. The OCFL eases content migrations by providing a technology agnostic method for verifying OCFL objects have remained fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Storage diversity
Finally, the community expressed a need to store content on a wide variety of storage technologies. With that in mind, the OCFL was written with an eye toward various storage infrastructures including cloud object stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second standard is Research Object Crate. (RO-Crate) a method for describing any dataset of local or remote resources as a digital object using a &lt;strong&gt;single linked-data metadata document&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RO-Crate is used in our platform both for describing data objects in the OCFL repository, and for delivering metadata over the API (which we’ll show in architecture diagrams and screenshots below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RO-Crates may contain any kind of data resource about anything, in any format as a file or URL - it’s not just for language data; there are also many projects in the sciences starting to &lt;a href="https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/in-use/"&gt;use RO-Crate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;https://pcdm.org/2016/04/18/models&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third key standard for Arkisto is the Portland Common Data Model. Like OCFL, this was developed by members of the digital library/repository community. It was devised as a way to do interchange between repository systems, most of which, it turned out had evolved very similar ways of having nested collections, digital objects that aggregate related files. Using this very simple ontology allows us to store data in the OCFL layer in a very flexible way - depending on factors like data size, licensing and whether data is likely to change or need to be withdrawn, we can store entire collections as OCFL objects or across many OCFL objects with PCDM used to show the structure of the data collections regardless of how they happen to be stored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RO-Crates are self-documenting and can ship with a HTML file that allows a consumer of the crated data to see whatever documentation the crate authors have added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This crate contains an entire collection (RepositoryCollection is the RO-Crate term that corresponds to pcdm:Collection).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crates must have license information that set out how data may be used and if it may be redistributed. As we are dealing with language data which is (almost) always created by people, it is important that their intellectual property rights and privacy are respected. More on this later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;' title='Slide: 7' border='1'  width='85%%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shows a page for what we’re calling an Object (RepositoryObject). A RepositoryObject is a single “thing” such as a document, a conversation, a session in a speech study. (this was called an item in Alveo but given that both the Portland Common Data model and Oxford Common File Layout use “Object” we are using that term at least for now).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shows that the system is capable of dealing with unicode characters - which is good, as you would expect as it’s 2022 and this is a Language Data Commons, but there are still challenges, like dealing with mixtures of left to right and right to left text, and we need to find or define metadata terms to keep track of “language”, “writing system”, and the difference between things that started as orthographic (written) text, vs spoken or signed etc. There’s a group of us working on that, currently led by Nick Thieberger and Peter Sefton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simon Musgrave and Peter Sefton &lt;a href="https://ptsefton.com/2022/01/27/DAMTA_Slides_v1/"&gt;presented our progress with multilingual text&lt;/a&gt; at a virtual workshop run by ANU in January.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above diagram takes a big-picture view of research data management in the context of &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt; research. It makes a distinction between managed repository storage and the places where work is done - “workspaces”. Workspaces are where researchers collect, analyse and describe data. Examples  include the most basic of research IT services, file storage as well as analytical tools such as Jupyter notebooks (the backbone of ATAP - the text analytics platform). Other examples of workspaces include code repositories such as GitHub or GitLab (a slightly different sense of the word repository), survey tools, electronic (lab) notebooks and bespoke code written for particular research programmes - these workspaces are essential research systems but usually are not set up for long term management of data.
The cycle in the centre of  this diagram shows an idealised research practice where data are collected and described and deposited into a repository frequently. Data are made findable and accessible  as soon as possible and can be “re-collected” for use and re-use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For data to be re-usable by humans and machines (such as ATAP notebook code that consumes datasets in a predictable way) it must be well described. The ATAP and LDaCA approach to this is to use the Research Object Crate (RO-Crate) specification. RO-Crate is essentially a guide to using a number of standards and standard approaches to describe both data and re-runnable software such as workflows or notebooks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This rather messy slide captures the overall high-level architecture for the LDaCA Research Data Commons  - there will be an analytical workbench (left of the diagram) which is the basis of the Australian Text Analytics (ATAP) project - this will focus on notebook-style programming using one of the emerging Jupyter notebook platforms in that space. (This is not 100% decided yet, but that has not stopped the team from starting to collect and develop notebooks that open up text analytics to new coders from the linguistics community.) Our engagement lead, Dr Simon Musgrave sees the ATAP work as primarily an educational enterprise encouraging researchers to adopt new research practices - which will be underpinned by services built on the Arkisto standards that allow for rigorous, re-runnable research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talking mainly about this bit today
' title='Slide: 11' border='1'  width='85%%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation we are going to focus on the portal/repository architecture more than on the ATAP notebook side of things. We know that we will be using (at least) the SWAN Jupyter notebook service perceived by AARNet but we are still scoping how notebooks will be made portable between systems and where they will be stored at various stages of their development. We will be supporting and encouraging researchers to archive notebooks wrapped in RO-Crates with re-use information OUTSIDE of the SWAN platform though - it’s a workspace, not a repository; it does not have governance in place for long term preservation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'&gt;
&lt;img src='https://ptsefton.com/2022/02/18/hass_rdc_tech_advisory/Slide12.png' alt='
&lt;p&gt;' title='Slide: 12' border='1'  width='85%%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a much simpler view zooming in on the core infrastructure components that we have built so far. We are starting with bulk ingest of existing collections and will add one-by-one deposit of individual items after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This show the OCFL repository at the bottom - with a Data &amp;amp; Access API that mediates access. This API understands the RO-Crate format and in particular its use of the Portland Common Data Model to structure data. The API also enforces access control to objects; every repository object has a license setting out the terms of use and re-use for its data, which will reflect the way the data were collected - whether participants signed agreements, ethics approvals and privacy law are all relevant here. Each license will correspond to a group of people who have agreed to and/or been selected by a data custodian. We are in negotiations with the &lt;a href="https://aaf.edu.au/"&gt;Australian Access Federation (AAF)&lt;/a&gt; to use their &lt;a href="https://www.cilogon.org/"&gt;CILogon&lt;/a&gt; service for this authorization step and for authentication of users across a wide variety of services including the AAF itself and Google, Microsoft, GitHub etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also an access portal which will be based on a full-text index (at this stage we’re using ElasticSearch) which is designed to help people find data they might be interested in using. This follows current conventions for browse/search interfaces which we’re familiar with from shopping sites - you can search for text and/or drill down using &lt;em&gt;facets&lt;/em&gt; (which are called aggregations in Elastic-land). eg which language am in interested in or do I want [ ] Spoken or [ ] Written material?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

There may be several portals using the same index - eg to give collection specific advanced search
There may be other kinds of index such as triple stores or relational databases that index tabular data 
' title='Slide: 13' border='1'  width='85%%'/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This architecture is very modular and designed to operate in a distributed fashion, potentially with distributed file and/or object based repositories all being indexed by a centralised service. There may also be other ‘flavours’ of index such as triple or graph stores, relational databases that ingest tabular data or domain specific discovery tools such as corpus analysis software. And, there may be collection specific portals that show a slice of a bigger repository with features or branding specific to a subset of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

' title='Slide: 14' border='1'  width='85%%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This implementation of the Arkisto standards-stack is known as Oni.  That’s not really an acronym any more though it once stood for OCFL, Ngnix (a web server) or Node (a Javascript framework)  and an Index. An Oni is a kind of Japanese demon. 👹&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;' title='Slide: 15' border='1'  width='85%%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how will data get into the OCFL repository? At the moment we’re loading data using a series of scripts which are being developed at our github organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This diagram and the next come from the &lt;a href="https://arkisto-platform.github.io/use-cases/"&gt;Arkisto Use cases page&lt;/a&gt; it show how we will be converting data from existing collections into a form where they can be preserved in an OCFL repository and be part of a bigger collection, ALWAYS with access control based on licenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a screenshot our github repository showing the corpus migration tools we’ve started developing (there are six, and one general purpose text-cleaning tool). These repositories have not all been made public yet, but they will be - they contain tools to build Arkisto-ready file repositories that can be made available in one or more portals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;img src='https://ptsefton.com/2022/02/18/hass_rdc_tech_advisory/Slide17.png' alt='PIC OF ALVEO
&lt;p&gt;' title='Slide: 17' border='1'  width='85%%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s our portal which give a browse interface to allow drill-down data discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait! That’s not the LDaCA portal - that’s Alveo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, so it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alveo was built ten years ago - and  has not seen a much uptake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'&gt;
&lt;img src='https://ptsefton.com/2022/02/18/hass_rdc_tech_advisory/Slide18.png' alt='
&lt;p&gt;' title='Slide: 18' border='1'  width='85%%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This screenshot shows some of the browse facets for the COOEE corpus, which contains early Australian &lt;strong&gt;written&lt;/strong&gt; English materials. But facets like &lt;code&gt;Written Mode&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Communication Medium&lt;/code&gt; both of which are known for COOEE are not populated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a quite few things that were wrong with Alveo - like we obviously didn’t get all the metadata populated to the level that it would make these browse facets actually useful for filtering. But more importantly, there was not enough work done to check which browse facets &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; useful and not enough of the budget was able to be spent on user engagement and training rather than software development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my current LDaCA senior colleagues said to me a couple of years ago that Alveo was useless:  “I just wanted to get all the data” they siad. Me, I was thinking “but it has an API so you CAN get all the data - what’s the problem?”. We have tried not to repeat this mistake by making sure that the API delivers entire collections and we have some demonstrations of doing this for real work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another colleague who was actually on the Alveo team said that this interface was &amp;quot;equally useless for everyone&amp;quot;, and they later built a custom interface for one of the collections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re taking these lessons to heart in designing the LDaCA infrastructure - making sure that as we go we have people using the software - it helps that we have an in house (though distributed) development team rather than an external contractor so feedback is very fast - we can jump onto a call and demo stuff at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'&gt;
&lt;img src='https://ptsefton.com/2022/02/18/hass_rdc_tech_advisory/oni-api-edit-2.gif' alt='API Demo' title='Slide: 19' border='1'  width='85%%'/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to build from the data API first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this demo developer Moises Sacal Bonequi is looking at the API via the Postman tool. This demonstration shows how the API can be used to find collections (that conform to our metadata profile)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First he lists the collections, then chooses one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He then gets a collection with the &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;resolve&lt;/code&gt; parameter, meaning that the API will internally traverse the PCDM collection hierarchy and return ALL the metadata for the collection - down to the file level&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He then downloads a file (for which he has a license that most of you reading this don’t have - hence the obfuscation of the dialogue)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This API has been used and road tested at ANU to develop techniques for topic modelling on the Sydney Speaks corpus (more about which corpus below) - by a student Marcel Reverter-Rambaldi under the supervision of  Prof Catherine Travis at ANU - we are hoping to publish this work as a re-usable notebook that can be adapted for other projects, and to allow the techniques the ANU team have been developing to be applied to other similar data in LDaCA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;' title='Slide: 20' border='1'  width='85%%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And one of the data scientists who was working with us at UQ, Mel Mistica, developed a &lt;a href="https://github.com/Australian-Text-Analytics-Platform/ro-crate-metadata/blob/main/ro-crate-metadata.ipynb"&gt;demonstration notebook&lt;/a&gt; with our tech team that used the API to access another full collection (which is also suitable for the ANU topic modelling approach) - this notebook gets all the metadata for a small social history collection which contains transcribed interviews with women in Western Sydney and shows how a data scientist might explore what’s in it and start asking questions about the data, like the age distribution of the participants and start digging in to what they were talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This screencast shows a work-in-progress snapshot of the Oni portal we talked about above in action, showing how search and browse might be used to find repository objects from the index - in this case searching for Arabic words in a small set of Australian Government documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hang on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You keep talking about “repositories” - don’t you always say stuff like &lt;a href="http://ptsefton.com/2012/02/14/an-australian-research-data-repository/"&gt;A repository is not just a software application. It’s a lifestyle. It’s not just for Christmas&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s right - we’ve been talking about repository software architectures here but it is important to remember that a repository needs to be considered an institution rather than a software stack or collection of files, more “University Library” than “My Database”.&lt;/p&gt;

Our demo today looks at this part …
' title='Slide: 23' border='1'  width='85%%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next half a dozen slides are based on &lt;a href="https://ptsefton.com/2021/10/12/ldaca2021/index.html"&gt;a presentation I gave at eResearch Australasia 2021 with Moises Sacal Bonequi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we will look in detail at one important part of this architecture - access control. How can we make sure that in a distributed system, with multiple data repositories and registries residing with different data custodians, the right people have access to the right data?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t spell this out in the recorded conference presentation, but for data that resides in the repositories at the right of the diagram we want to encourage research processes that clearly separate data from code. Notebooks and other code workflows that use data will fetch a version-controlled reference copy from a repository - using an access key if needed, process the data and produce results that are then deposited into an appropriate repository alongside the code itself.  Given that a lot of the data in the language world is NOT available under open licenses such as Creative Commons it is important to establish this practice - each user of the data must negotiate or be granted access individually. Research can still be reproducible using this model, but without a culture of sharing datasets without regard for the rights of those who were involved in the creation of the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'&gt;
&lt;img src='https://ptsefton.com/2022/02/18/hass_rdc_tech_advisory/Slide24.png' alt='
&lt;p&gt;' title='Slide: 24' border='1'  width='85%%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding rights, our project is informed by the &lt;a href="https://www.gida-global.org/care"&gt;CARE principles&lt;/a&gt; for Indigenous data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current movement toward open data and open science does not fully engage with Indigenous Peoples rights and interests. Existing principles within the open data movement (e.g. FAIR: findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) primarily focus on characteristics of data that will facilitate increased data sharing among entities while ignoring power differentials and historical contexts. The emphasis on greater data sharing alone creates a tension for Indigenous Peoples who are also asserting greater control over the application and use of Indigenous data and Indigenous Knowledge for collective benefit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we do not see the CARE principles as only applying to Indigenous data and knowledge. Most language data is a record of the behaviour of people who have moral rights in the material (even if they do not have legal rights) and taking the CARE principles as relevant in such cases ensures serious thinking about the protection of tose moral rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'&gt;

&lt;p&gt;' title='Slide: 25' border='1'  width='85%%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://localcontexts.org/labels/traditional-knowledge-labels/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are designing the system so that it can work with diverse ways of expressing access rights, for example licensing like the Tribal Knowledge labels.The idea is to separate safe storage of data with a license on each item, which may reference the TK labels from a system that is administered by the data custodians who can make decisions about who is allowed to access data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;img src='https://ptsefton.com/2022/02/18/hass_rdc_tech_advisory/Slide26.png' alt='Case Study - Sydney Speaks
&lt;p&gt;' title='Slide: 26' border='1'  width='85%%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are working on a case-study with the &lt;a href="http://www.dynamicsoflanguage.edu.au/sydney-speaks/"&gt;Sydney Speaks project&lt;/a&gt; via steering committee member Catherine Travis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project seeks to document and explore Australian English, as spoken in Australia’s largest and most ethnically and linguistically diverse city – Sydney.
The title “Sydney Speaks” captures a key defining feature of the project: the data come from recorded conversations between Sydney siders, as they tell stories about their lives and experiences, their opinions and attitudes. This allows us to measure how their lived experiences impact their speech patterns.
Working within the framework of variationist sociolinguistics, we examine variation in phonetics, grammar and discourse, in an effort to answer questions of fundamental interest both to Australian English, and language variation and change more broadly, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How has Australian English as spoken in Sydney changed over the past 100 years?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has the change in the ethnic diversity over that time period (and in particular, over the past 40 years) had any impact on the way Australian English is spoken?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What affects the way variation and change spread through society
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who are the initiators and who are the leaders in change?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do social networks function in a modern metropolis?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What social factors are relevant to Sydney speech today, and over time (gender? class? region? ethnic identity?)
A better understanding of what kind of variation exists in Australian English, and of how and why Australian English has changed over time can help society be more accepting of speech variation and even help address prejudices based on ways of speaking.

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collection contains recordings of people speaking both contemporary and historic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because this involved human participants there are restrictions on the distribution of data - a situation we see with lots of studies involving people in a huge range of disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are four tiers of data access we need to enforce and observe for this data based on the participant agreements and ethics arrangements under which the data were collected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concerns about rights and interests are important for any data involving people - and a large amount the data both indigenous and non-indigenous we are using will require access control that ensures that data sharing is appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

' title='Slide: 28' border='1'  width='85%%'/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example demo we uploaded various collections and are authorising with Github organisations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a our production release we will use AAF to authorise different groups&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's find a dataset: The Sydney Speaks Corpus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see we cannot see any data&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets login… We authorise Github…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you can see we have access sub corpus data and I am just opening a couple of items&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in Github we can see the group management example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have given access to all the licences to myself, as you can see here and given access to licence A to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This diagram is a sketch of the interaction that took place in the demo - it shows how a repository can delegate authorization to an external system - in this case Github rather than CILogon. But we are working with the ARDC to set up a trial with the Australian Access Federation to allow CILogon access for the HASS Research Data Commons so we can pilot group-based access control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;img src='https://ptsefton.com/2022/02/18/hass_rdc_tech_advisory/Slide30.png' alt='TODO
Scope the infrastructure we need to support this (need more clarity on what data we will have and where it will be housed)
Improve our testing for scale and implement Continuous Integration so we don’t break things with every new Corpus that comes on board
Pick our metadata terms we will probably build on the OLAC (Open Language Archives) vocabularies - but there are other options such as the CLARIN (Eu) vocabs
Integrate better with the Australian Text Analytics Platform ATAP - eg fire up a notebook from the search portal to operate on a collection of interest
' title='Slide: 30' border='1'  width='85%%'/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot still to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;About this event&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of DH tools and methods have been applied across a variety of corpora but text-analysis of English language sources has dominated this field. These approaches are increasingly being used in languages and linguistics research for non-English corpora. At the same time, the integration of these tools has seen new research questions and possibilities emerge, including questions such as “Is there a non-Anglo digital humanities (DH), and if so, what are its characteristics” (Fiormonte 2016: 438). Recent studies have begun to examine aspects such as OCR for historical text analysis and data mining (Hill &amp;amp; Hengchen 2019; Goodman et al. 2018), multilingual computation analysis (Dombrowski 2020), semantic and sentiment analysis (Daems et al. 2019) and historical linguistics (Evans 2016), among others. The papers in this conference present a diverse range of projects and critiques of digital methods across different languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src='https://ptsefton.com/2022/01/27/DAMTA_Slides_v1/Slide1.png' alt='Why we need research infrastructure
Collecting data is time-consuming (expensive)
Making data reusable while respecting rights is very desirable
FAIR and CARE principles should guide us
Managing this at the level of individual projects is onerous
Even for small datasets
Separate infrastructure encourages best practices
FAIRer data
Wider availability of data management expertise
Better alignment with technology change
' title='1' border='1'  width='85%'/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we accept that making sharing and reuse of data (consistent with ethical considerations) should be the default, managing even small amounts of data can be onerous. Having infrastructures which can take on the task relieves researchers of some of this burden and brings advantages: more reliable &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618"&gt;FAIR&lt;/a&gt; compliance, access to data management experts, more responsive to changing technology (at least for the life of the infrastructure)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;img src='https://ptsefton.com/2022/01/27/DAMTA_Slides_v1/Slide2.png' alt='Introducing the Language Data Commons of Australia (LDaCA)
LDaCA will make nationally significant language data available for academic and non-academic use and provides a model for ensuring continued access with appropriate community control
LDaCA aims to provide access to materials which record language use in Australia
In some cases, LDaCA will provide federated access to existing collections
In other cases, LDaCA will be a repository 
' title='2' border='1'  width='85%'/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of where data is housed, access will be through one portal (external data may also be accessible by other routes). Access control will follow the &lt;a href="https://www.gida-global.org/care"&gt;CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance&lt;/a&gt; where original providers of data have moral rights which must be considered, data owners/custodians will control lists of authorised users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;img src='https://ptsefton.com/2022/01/27/DAMTA_Slides_v1/Slide3.png' alt='Multilingual material
Multilingual Australia (ABS data):
In 2016, there were over 300 separately identified languages spoken in Australian homes
More than one-fifth (21 per cent) of Australians spoke a language other than English at home
An infrastructure with the stated aims of LDaCA has to be able to handle data:
From multiple languages
With multiple writing systems
With multiple annotations (translations, phonetics, syntax etc)
In principle, Unicode encoding and suitable fonts should be capable of doing this
How does it work in practice?
' title='3' border='1'  width='85%'/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'record language use in Australia' covers a huge range of possibilities. Current figures on slide, plus at least 250 Australian languages pre-European arrival, at least half no longer spoken but records remain (not for all). Unicode is not always without problems – how are we doing in meeting these goals so far? First, the architecture....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;img src='https://ptsefton.com/2022/01/27/DAMTA_Slides_v1/Slide4.png' alt='LDaCA Architecture
' title='4' border='1'  width='85%'/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LDaCA technical architecture is based on the &lt;a href="https://arkisto-platform.github.io/"&gt;Arkisto platform&lt;/a&gt;, storing data in the &lt;a href="https://arkisto-platform.github.io/standards/ocfl/"&gt;Oxford Common File Layout&lt;/a&gt; (OCFL), with data objects such as linguistic items and collections described in detail using &lt;a href="https://arkisto-platform.github.io/standards/ro-crate/"&gt;Research Object Crate&lt;/a&gt; (RO-Crate). RO-Crate is a linked-data approach to describing data which is based on widely used standards for structural and descriptive properties such as dates and contributors, with extensions for language data being built on work in the &lt;a href="http://www.language-archives.org/"&gt;Open Language Archives&lt;/a&gt; (OLAC). RO-Crate is an international collaboration with diverse contributors, the specification is in English and most RO-Crates at this point have English metadata and contents, but there is demand for content in other languages and future versions of the spec will cover multilingual use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;img src='https://ptsefton.com/2022/01/27/DAMTA_Slides_v1/Slide5.png' alt='The demonstration material
All levels of government in Australia make documents available in multiple languages
Demonstration corpus uses documents from:
Services Australia
Department of Health (Victoria)
Languages:
Arabic
Farsi (Persian)
Turkish
Vietnamese
Chinese (simplified characters)
' title='5' border='1'  width='85%'/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simon pointed out here that the languages all use different writing systems, 3 completely distinct systems (Turkish and Vietnamese use extended Roman scripts, Farsi uses an Arabic based script)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This quick demonstration screencast shows a work-in-progress prototype of the LDaCA portal which will give controlled access to language resources to those who are licensed to see them  – in this demonstrator we have openly available multilingual Australian Government documents in PDF and text format and a small history dataset containing interviews with women from Western Sydney, &lt;a href="http://omeka.uws.edu.au/farmstofreeways/"&gt;Farms to Freeways&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually the LDaCA repository will contain a wide variety of data including speech, video, sign, images and digitized text with a browse and search interface to allow researchers to find data they are interested in – provided, of course that they have been granted an appropriate licence to view and use the data. In this demonstration our colleague Moises Sacal Bonequi peforms searches in different languages to find repository objects of interest. Each object has multiple translations stored in separate files, in both PDF and text format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;img src='https://ptsefton.com/2022/01/27/DAMTA_Slides_v1/Slide7.png' alt='Why bother? 
What are the relevant data sources?
Lots more government documents
Serial publications:
Tim Sherratt lists 52 non-English sources in Trove
31 commenced publication before 1945
German prominent in C19
Substantial resources &amp;gt;1945 in Italian and Greek
Chinese publications always present
Use of LOTEs in Australia is under-researched, huge opportunities to collect data
' title='7' border='1'  width='85%'/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there data in Australia which makes it worth worrying about this? Yes – at least two important sources of written material, plus this is an under-researched field with lots of questions to be answered and therefore lots of data to be collected. For example, there is research on differing usage in Vietnamese depending on speakers' time of arrival in Australia (1970s v. later), yet to be replicated with other similarly time-layered communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the abstract as submitted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Language Data Commons of Australia Data Partnerships (LDaCA) and the Australian Text Analytics Platform (ATAP) are building towards a scalable and flexible language data and analytics commons. These projects will be  part of the Humanities and Social Sciences Research Data Commons (HASS RDC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Data Commons will focus on preservation and discovery of distributed multi-modal language data collections under a variety of governance frameworks. This will include access control that reflects ethical constraints and intellectual property rights, including those of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander,  migrant and Pacific communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The platform will provide workbench services to support computational research, starting with code-notebooks with no-code research tools provided in later phases. Research artefacts such as code and derived data will be made available as fully documented research objects that are re-runnable and rigorously described. Metrics to demonstrate the impact of the platform are projected to include usage statistics, data and article citations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation we will present the proposed architecture of the system, the principles that informed it and demonstrate the first version. Features of the solution include the use of the Arkisto Platform (presented at eResearch 2020), which leverages the Oxford Common File Layout. This enables storing complete version-controlled digital objects described using linked data with rich context via the Research Object Crate (RO-Crate) format. The solution features a distributed authorization model where the agency archiving data may be separate from that authorising access.&lt;/p&gt;

make data from ATAP and LDaCA and collections discoverable - with the caveat that harvesting harmonised metadata from existing corpora may be difficult
Provide workbench services for computational research - starting with code-notebooks but with the aim of building towards no-code environments and automatically re-runnable workflows
include clear licensing on all data and code on how data may be reused, informed by a legally sound policy framework, with an access-control framework to allow automated data access where possible (there are some external dependencies here)
be distributed - with data held by a number of different organizations under a variety of governance models and technologies  (potentially including copies for redundancy or to put data close to compute  and analytical services)

' title='5' border='1'  width='85%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diagram which we developed with Marco La Rosa makes a distinction between managed repository storage and the places where work is done - “workspaces”. Workspaces are where researchers collect, analyse and describe data. Examples  include the most basic of research IT services, file storage as well as analytical tools such as Jupyter notebooks (the backbone of ATAP - the text analytics platform). Other examples of workspaces include code repositories such as GitHub or GitLab (a slightly different sense of the word repository), survey tools, electronic (lab) notebooks and bespoke code written for particular research programmes - these workspaces are essential research systems but usually are not set up for long term management of data.
The cycle in the centre of  this diagram shows an idealised research practice where data are collected and described and deposited into a repository frequently. Data are made findable and accessible  as soon as possible and can be “re-collected” for use and re-use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For data to be re-usable by humans and machines (such as ATAP notebook code that consumes datasets in a predictable way) it must be well described. The ATAP and LDaCA approach to this is to use the Research Object Crate (RO-Crate) specification. RO-Crate is essentially a guide to using a number of standards and standard approaches to describe both data and re-runnable software such as workflows or notebooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of the previous high-level map distinguishing workspaces and repository services, we are using the Arkisto Platform (introduced &lt;a href="http://ptsefton.com/2020/11/23/Arkisto/index.html"&gt;at eResearch 2020&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arkisto is an approach to eResearch service that places the emphasis on ensuring the long term preservation of data independently of code and services - recognizing the ephemeral nature of software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PARADISEC has viewers for various content types: video and audio with time aligned transcriptions, image set viewers and document viewers (xml, pdf and microsoft formats). We are working on making these viewers available across Arkisto sites by having a standard set of hooks for adding viewer plugins to a site as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This slide captures the overall high-level architecture - there will be an analytical workbench (left of the diagram) which is the basis of the Australian Text Analytics (ATAP) project - this will focus on notebook-style programming using one of the emerging Jupyter notebook platforms in that space. The exact platform is not 100% decided yet, but that has not stopped the team from starting to collect and develop notebooks that open up text analytics to new coders from the linguistics community. Our engagement lead, Dr Simon Musgrave sees the ATAP work as primarily an educational enterprise - which will be underpinned by services built on the Arkisto standards that allow for rigorous, re-runnable research.&lt;/p&gt;

Our demo today looks at this part …
' title='9' border='1'  width='85%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we will look in detail at one important part of this architecture - access control. How can we make sure that in a distributed system, with multiple data repositories and registries residing with different data custodians, the right people have access to the right data?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t spell this out in the recorded conference presentation, but for data that resides in the repositories at the right of the diagram we want to encourage research processes that clearly separate data from code. Notebooks and other code workflows that use data will fetch a version-controlled reference copy from a repository - using an access key if needed, process the data and produce results that are then deposited into an appropriate repository alongside the code itself.  Given that a lot of the data in the language world is NOT available under open licenses such as Creative Commons it is important to establish this practice - each user of the data must negotiate or be granted access individually. Research can still be reproducible using this model, but without a culture of sharing datasets without regard for the rights of those who were involved in the creations of the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'&gt;

&lt;p&gt;' title='10' border='1'  width='85%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding rights, our project is informed by the &lt;a href="https://www.gida-global.org/care"&gt;CARE principles&lt;/a&gt; for indegenous data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current movement toward open data and open science does not fully engage with Indigenous Peoples rights and interests. Existing principles within the open data movement (e.g. FAIR: findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) primarily focus on characteristics of data that will facilitate increased data sharing among entities while ignoring power differentials and historical contexts. The emphasis on greater data sharing alone creates a tension for Indigenous Peoples who are also asserting greater control over the application and use of Indigenous data and Indigenous Knowledge for collective benefit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;https://localcontexts.org/labels/traditional-knowledge-labels/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are designing the system so that it can work with diverse ways of expressing access rights, for example licensing like the Tribal Knowledge labels.The idea is to separate safe storage of data with a license on each item, which may reference the TK labels from a system that is administered by the data custodians who can make decisions about who is allowed to access data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;img src='https://ptsefton.com/2021/10/12/ldaca2021/Slide12.png' alt='Case Study - Sydney Speaks
&lt;p&gt;' title='12' border='1'  width='85%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are working on a case-study with the &lt;a href="http://www.dynamicsoflanguage.edu.au/sydney-speaks/"&gt;Sydney Speaks project&lt;/a&gt; via steering committee member Professor Catherine Travis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project seeks to document and explore Australian English, as spoken in Australia’s largest and most ethnically and linguistically diverse city – Sydney.
The title “Sydney Speaks” captures a key defining feature of the project: the data come from recorded conversations between Sydney siders, as they tell stories about their lives and experiences, their opinions and attitudes. This allows us to measure how their lived experiences impact their speech patterns.
Working within the framework of variationist sociolinguistics, we examine variation in phonetics, grammar and discourse, in an effort to answer questions of fundamental interest both to Australian English, and language variation and change more broadly, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How has Australian English as spoken in Sydney changed over the past 100 years?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has the change in the ethnic diversity over that time period (and in particular, over the past 40 years) had any impact on the way Australian English is spoken?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What affects the way variation and change spread through society
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who are the initiators and who are the leaders in change?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do social networks function in a modern metropolis?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What social factors are relevant to Sydney speech today, and over time (gender? class? region? ethnic identity?)
A better understanding of what kind of variation exists in Australian English, and of how and why Australian English has changed over time can help society be more accepting of speech variation and even help address prejudices based on ways of speaking.

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collection contains recordings of people speaking both contemporary and historic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because this involved human participants there are restrictions on the distribution of data - a situation we see with lots of studies involving people in a huge range of disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'&gt;
&lt;img src='https://ptsefton.com/2021/10/12/ldaca2021/Slide13.png' alt='Sydney Speaks Licenses
' title='13' border='1'  width='85%'/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are four tiers of data access we need to enforce and observe for this data based on the participant agreements and ethics arrangements under which the data were collected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concerns about rights and interests are important for any data involving people - and a large amount the data both indigenous and non-indigenous we are using will require access control that ensures that data sharing is appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'&gt;
&lt;img src='https://ptsefton.com/2021/10/12/ldaca2021/Slide14.gif' alt='Demo
' title='14' border='1'  width='85%'/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example demo we uploaded various collections and are authorising with Github organisations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a our production release we will use AAF to authorise different groups&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's find a dataset: The Sydney Speaks Corpus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see we cannot see any data&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets login… We authorise Github…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you can see we have access sub corpus data and I am just opening a couple of items&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in Github we can see the group management example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have given access to all the licences to myself, as you can see here and given access to licence A to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'&gt;

&lt;p&gt;' title='15' border='1'  width='85%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This diagram is a sketch of the interaction that took place in the demo - it shows how a repository can delegate authorization to an external system - in this case Github rather than CILogon. But we are working with the ARDC to set up a trial with the Australian Access Federation to allow CILogon access for the HASS Research Data Commons so we can pilot group-based access control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: This diagram has been updated slightly from the version presented at the conference to make it clear that the lookup to find the licence for the data set is &lt;em&gt;internal&lt;/em&gt; to the repository - the id is a DOI but it is not being resolved over the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, about work which is still very much under construction, we have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shown an overview of a complete Data Commons Architecture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Previewed a distributed access-control mechanism which will separates out the the job of storing and delivering data from that of authorising access&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We'll be back next year with more about how analytics and data repositories connect using structure and linked data.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Update 2021-06-16: had some comments from Michael D'Silva at AARNet - have added a couple of things below.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am posting this now because I have joined a pair of related projects as a senior technical advisor and an we will have to look at access-authorization to data on both - licenses will vary from open, to click-through agreements, to complex cultural restrictions such as &lt;a href="https://publish.illinois.edu/commonsknowledge/2017/09/07/an-introduction-to-traditional-knowledge-labels-and-licenses/#:~:text=Traditional%20knowledge%2C%20or%20TK%2C%20labels,data%20management%20and%20presentation%20strategies."&gt;TK Licenses&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.47486/PL074"&gt;Australian Text Analytics Platform (ATAP)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://ardc.edu.au/news/a-national-language-data-commons-for-australia/"&gt;Language Data Commons for Australia (LDaCA)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary:&lt;/strong&gt; Not all research data can be made openly available (for ethical, safety, privacy, commercial or other reasons) but a lot &lt;em&gt;can reasonably be sent over the web to trusted parties&lt;/em&gt;. If we want to make it accessible (as per the &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data"&gt;FAIR data&lt;/a&gt; principles) then at present each data repository/service has to handle its own access controls. In this post I argue that if we had a &lt;em&gt;Group Service&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Licence Service&lt;/em&gt; that allowed research teams to build their own groups and/or licences then the service could issue a Group Access Licence URLs. Other services such as repositories in a trusted relationship with the &lt;em&gt;Group/Licence Service&lt;/em&gt; holding content with digital licences which had such URLs could do a redirect dance (like with oAuth and other authentication protocols), sending the users who request access to digital objects to the &lt;em&gt;Group/Licence Service&lt;/em&gt; which could authenticate them and check if they have access rights then let the repository know whether or not to give them access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post I will look at some missing infrastructure for doing &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data"&gt;FAIR data&lt;/a&gt; (Reminder: FAIR is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable data) - and will cite the FAIR principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a dataset can be released under an open licence then that's no problem but if data is only available for reuse under some special circumstances to certain users for certain purposes then the research sector lacks general-purpose infrastructure to support this. Tech infrastrucure aside, we do have a way of handling this legally. You specify these special conditions using a &lt;em&gt;licence&lt;/em&gt; as per the FAIR principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R1.1. (Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage licence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The licence might say (in your local natural language) &amp;quot;Members of international research project XYX can access this dataset&amp;quot;. Or &amp;quot;contact us for a specific licence (and we'll add you to a license-holder group if approved)&amp;quot;. [Update: 2021-06-16 Or This content is licensed to an individual ID]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the dataset can be deposited in a repository, which will take care of &lt;em&gt;some of&lt;/em&gt; the FAIR principles for you including the F-word stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Findable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step in (re)using data is to find them. Metadata and data should be easy to find for both humans and computers. Machine-readable metadata are essential for automatic discovery of datasets and services, so this is an essential component of the FAIRification process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F1. (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F2. Data are described with rich metadata (defined by R1 below)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F3. Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F4. (Meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, you could somehow deal with all that with some bespoke software service, but the simplest solution is to use a repository, or if there isn't one, work with infrastructure people to set one up - there are a number of software solutions that can help provide all the needed services.  The repository will typically issue persistent identifiers for digital objects and serve up data using a standarised communication protocol (usually) HTTP(S).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Accessible&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the user finds the required data, they need to know how they can be accessed, possibly including authentication and authorisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A1. (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardised communications protocol&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A1.1 The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A1.2 The protocol allows for an authentication and authorization procedure, where necessary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A2. Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But repository software can not be trusted to understand license text and thus cannot work out who to make non-open data available &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; - so what will (usually) happen is it will either just make the non-open data available only to the depositor and administrators. The default is to make it &lt;em&gt;Inaccessible&lt;/em&gt; via what repository people call &amp;quot;mediated access&amp;quot; - ie you have to contact someone to ask for access and then they have to figure out how to get the data to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the Australian Data Archive they have the &amp;quot;request access&amp;quot; part automated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4 - DOWNLOADING DATA&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To download open access data and documentation, click on the “Download” button next to the file you are interested in. Much of the data in the ADA collection has controlled access, denoted by a red lock icon next to the file. Files with controlled access require you to request access to the data, by clicking on the “Request Access” button.
&lt;a href="https://ada.edu.au/accessing-data/"&gt;https://ada.edu.au/accessing-data/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases the repository itself will have some kind of built in access control using groups, or licences or some-such. For example, the &lt;a href="https://alveo.edu.au/"&gt;Alveo&lt;/a&gt; virtual lab funded by NeCTAR in Australia, on which I worked, has a local licence checker, as each collection has a licence. Some licences just require a click-through agreement, others are associated with lists of users who have paid money, or are blessed by a group-owner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not citing Alveo as a much-used or successful service, it was not, overall, a great success in terms of uptake, but I think it has a good data-licence architecture; there is a licence-component that was separate from the rest of the system. The licence checking sits in front of the &amp;quot;Findability&amp;quot; part of the data and the API - not much of that data is available without at least some kind of licence that users have to agree to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://ptsefton.com/2021/06/11/faira/plantuml_Alveo.png" alt="Diagram"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pattern makes a clear separation between the licence as an abstract, identifiable thing, and a service to keep track of who holds the licence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question is, could we do something like this at national or global scale?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are part of the way there - we can authenticate users in a number of ways, eg by the Australian Access Federation (&lt;a href="https://aaf.edu.au/"&gt;AAF&lt;/a&gt;) and equivalents around the world, and there are protocols that allow a service to authenticate using Google, Facebook, Github et al. These all rely on variants of a pattern where a user of service &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; is redirected to an authentication service &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; where they put in their password or a one-time key, and whatever other mechanism the IT department deem necessary, and then are redirected back to service &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; with an assurance from &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; that this person is who they say they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we don't have (as far as I'm aware) is a general purpose protocol for checking whether someone holds a licence. A repository could redirect a web user to a Group Licence Server and the user could transact with the licence service, authenticate themselves (in whatever way that licence service supports) and then the licence service could check it's internal lists of who has what licence and then return it. If the license is just a click through then the user could to the clicking - or request access,or pay money or whatever is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update: 2021-06-16 This class of service would also be useful for provisioning access to things other than data - such as compute or other workspace resources. Making this a standard protocol means that these services could be offered by different organizations, yes we want national ones but for some kinds of sensitive data a community might want to run and control their own.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(We are aware of the work on FAIR Digital Objects and the &lt;a href="https://fairdo.org/"&gt;FDO Forum&lt;/a&gt; - it does say there that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FAIR Digital Objects (FDO) provide a conceptual and implementation framework to develop scalable cross-disciplinary capabilities, deal with the increasing data volumes and their inherent complexity, build tools that help to increase trust in data, create mechanisms to efficiently operate in the domain of scientific assertions, and promote data interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colleagues and I have started discussions with the folks there.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those of us who were around higher-ed-tech in the '00s in Australia will remember &lt;a href="https://slideplayer.com/slide/1514611/"&gt;MAMS&lt;/a&gt; - the Meta Access Management system - the leader James Dalziel was at all the eResearch-ish conferences talking about this shared federation (that would allow you to log in to other people's systems (we got that - it's the aforementioned AAF), with fantastic user stories about being able to log into a data repository and then by virtue of the fact that you're a female anthropologist, gain access to some cultural resources (we didn't get that bit). I remember &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/kent-fitch-137926"&gt;Kent Fitch&lt;/a&gt; then from the National Library, one of the team that build the national treasure &lt;a href="https://trove.nla.gov.au/"&gt;Trove 😀&lt;/a&gt; bursting that particular bubble over beers after one such talk. He asked: How do you identify an anthropologist? Answer - a university authentication system certainly can't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realised a long long time later that while you can't identify the anthropologists, or tell 'em apart from the ethnographers or ethnomusicologists etc that they &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; and make their own groups, via research projects, collaborations and scholarly societies. You &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; have a group that listed the members of a scholarly society and use that for certain kinds of access control, and you could, of course let the researchers self select people they want to share with - let &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt; set up &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if we had a class of stand-alone service where anyone could set up a group and add users to it? A project lead could decide on what is an acceptable way to authenticate, via Academic Federations like AAF or ORCID, public services like Github or Facebook etc and then add a list of users via email addresses or other IDs. And what if there was a way to auto-populate that group by linking through to &lt;a href="https://osf.io/"&gt;OSF&lt;/a&gt; groups, or Github organisations, Slack etc (all of which use different APIs and none of which know about licences in this sense as far as I know). This would be useful for groups of researchers who need access to storage, compute, and yes, datasets with particular licence provisions. There could be free-to-use group access for individuals and paid services for orgs like learned societies who can use the list to make deals with infrastructure providers for example. And there need not only be one of these services, they'd work well at a National level I think but could be more granular or discipline based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Does such a thing already exist? Did I miss it? Let me know in the comments below or on twitter - I'm @ptsefton)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could do this something like the way modern authentication services work with a simple hand-off of a user to an authentication service, but with the addition of licence URL, to a service that says - yep I vouch for this person they have a licence to see the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://ptsefton.com/2021/06/11/faira/plantuml_FAIRA.png" alt="Diagram"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above interaction diagram is purely a fantasy of mine. I'm not an Internet Engineer - so I have probably made some horrible errors, please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously this requires a trust-framework; repositories would have to trust the licence servers and vice-versa and these relationships would have to be time-limited and renewable. You wouldn't want to trust a service for longer than their domain registration for example in case someone else you don't trust buys the domain, that kind of thing. And you'd want some public key stuff happening so that transactions are signed (a further mitigation against domain squatters - they would presumably not have your private key).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is not an overly complicated application we're talking about - all access-controlled APIs already have to do some of this locally. It's the the governance - the trust federations that will take time and significant resources (so lets start now :-).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while we're on the subject of trust - this scheme would work in the same way most research does - with trust in the people working on the projects - typically they have access to data and are trusted to keep it safe. Being a member of a project team in health research, for example often involves joining a host organization as an honorary staff member, and being subject to all its policies and procedures. Some research groups have high levels of governance; people are identified using things like nursing registrations, and other certifications; some are ad-hoc collections of people identified by a PI using any old-email address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: for data that needs to be kept really really secure? Data that can never even be put on a hard drive and left on a bus - then this proposal is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the scheme for that data - that's where you'd be looking at a Secure eResearch Platform (SeRP) where the data lives in a walled garden and can be inspected only via a locked-down terminal application, or even stricter, you might only have secure on-site access to data that's air-gapped from any network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a sketch of some infrastructure. Essentially this is what happened inside Alveo - the question is can it be distributed so repositories can be de-coupled from authorization services?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This schematic is a high level view of research data management showing workspaces enabling research activities (collect, analyse, describe) linked to repositories in a continuous cycle. This is similar to the software development model of commit early and commit often but in this case, deposit well described objects often and re-use as required. Workspaces can include systems like Redcap, OwnCloud and other active work systems and they should be treated as ephemeral and dirty. Repositories can include systems like Zenodo and Figshare where FAIR objects are managed for long term preservation and re-use.&lt;/p&gt;

🐩
' title='3' border='1'  width='85%'/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data must be well described in open standards
Data not locked up
We know it’s portable between applications
Data storage layer is COMPLETELY separate from the services layer(s)
So how? Use standards.... Weren’t you wondering about the picture of a STANDARD Poodle?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ANSWER:  OCFL&lt;br /&gt;
' title='4' border='1'  width='85%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UTS has been an early adopter of the OCFL (Oxford Common File Layout) specification - a way of storing file sustainably on a file system (coming soon: s3 cloud storage) so it does not need to be migrated. I [presented on this at the Open Repositories conference] (https://eresearch.uts.edu.au/2019/07/01/OCLF.htm). PARADISEC has built a scalable and performant demonstrator using OCFL.
Completeness, so that a repository can be rebuilt from the files it stores
Parsability, both by humans and machines, to ensure content can be understood in the absence of original software
Robustness against errors, corruption, and migration between storage technologies
Versioning, so repositories can make changes to objects allowing their history to persist
Storage diversity, to ensure content can be stored on diverse storage infrastructures including conventional filesystems and cloud object stores&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an example of service connection in the CS3MESH4EOSC. In this schematic we can see a FAIR Description Service forming the bridge between the CS3MESH4EOSC services (workspaces) and various repositories. A FAIR description service uses linked-data to describe data and its context. The next slide shows some of what you might want to add to a Digital Object (data package) to make it Findable, Interoperable and Reusable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RO-Crate is method for describing a dataset as a digital object using a &lt;strong&gt;single linked-data metadata document&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lightweight approach to packaging research data with metadata - the examples here aid in the F, A, I and R in FAIR. For example “how can it be reused” means a data licence that specifies who can access, use and distribute data. And “How was it made” is important for reuse and interoperability - think file formats, resolution etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Community effort - 40+ contributors from AU, EU and US.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can aggregate files and/or any URI-addressable content, with contextual information to aid decisions about re-use. (Who What When Where Why How).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uses Schema.org as the main ontology, with domain-specific extensions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has human readable summaries of datasets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When your data is well described you can start thinking about higher level processes and workflows connecting workspaces to repositories. And your services can evolve over time as requirements change and systems improve without needing to transform your data first. Too often research data management infrastructures get caught up in the specific technologies / systems to be implemented without considering how an ecosystem of services can work as whole. If the previous architecture slide was a low level view of the CS3MESH4EOSC implementation then this is a higher level view of a possible architecture that connects workspaces to repositories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Provisioning
' title='8' border='1'  width='85%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going up another few levels we can see that the picture is incomplete. The environment of repositories and workspaces needs more services to actually form a functional system for end users. Going forward we need to think about how to do cross-service authentication of parties and authorization of access to resources,  and group membership; licensing, environment provisioning etc. In this way we can tie together the active workspaces and repository services into a cohesive application for end users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(See a &lt;a href="/2021/06/11/faira"&gt;blog post from Peter Sefton floating ideas about how we might close this gap specifically for data-access licenses&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a schematic of just such an environment at UTS - this shows how the the Stash research data management system, which is an instance of &lt;a href="https://www.redboxresearchdata.com.au/"&gt;ReDBox&lt;/a&gt;, orchestrates workspaces and connects them to a research data catalogue (which is actually now a repository).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A human-readable description and preview can be in an HTML file that lives alongside the metadata&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this mean for repositories? It means that a repository can show the contents of a digital object using either a standard display library, or a customised one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Provenance and workflow information can be included - to assist in data and research-process re-use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this mean for repositories? Repositories will be able to launch software environments; if the digital object can be run in an emulator, or a notebook environment then there is potential to launch that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;WorkflowHub.eu&amp;gt; is a European cross-domain registry of computational workflows, supported by European Open Science Cloud projects, e.g. &lt;a href="https://www.eosc-life.eu/"&gt;EOSC-Life&lt;/a&gt;, and research infrastructures including the pan-European bioinformatics network &lt;a href="https://elixir-europe.org/"&gt;ELIXIR&lt;/a&gt;. As part of promoting workflows as reusable tools, WorkflowHub includes documentation and high-level rendering of the workflow structure independent of its native workflow definition format. The rationale is that a domain scientist can browse all relevant workflows for their domain, before narrowing down their workflow engine requirements. As such, the WorkflowHub is intended largely as a registry of workflows already deposited in repositories specific to particular workflow languages and domains, such as UseGalaxy.euand Nextflow nf-core .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Updated 2021-05-23 further minor punctuation changes]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was invited to speak at an RDA (Research Data Alliance) 'Infrastructure and Data Management Plans (DMPs)' webinar on May 18th as part of a panel talking about Data Management Plans and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are my slides for my five minutes of RDA-fame - with some notes about what I said, some things I forgot to say and some things I learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liz Stokes from ARDC asked me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Could I suggest that you focus on what people should expect from DMP infrastructure and talk about how infrastructure can encourage good data management practices?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me being me I took the &amp;quot;what people should expect&amp;quot; as an opportunity to reflect not just on current infrastructure but also on what's needed for the future; where the gaps are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Preamble&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found this session very useful. Recently I have been working on the &lt;em&gt;A-is-for-accessible&lt;/em&gt; in FAIR, looking at how do we provide access to non-open research data that requires a specific license agreement for access and use, usually for privacy, ethical or commercial reasons. The simplest approach to this that I can think of is to create data licences, which would have human readable licence terms, that apply to a certain group of people, and to let the data custodian or a particular non-open dataset decide how to manage these groups of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does the group consist of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A named list of project collaborators?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A click-through licence where we identify a person and then keep track of the fact they clicked it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A commercial arrangement like a subscription where downloads are available for a certain time?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A repository would not need to worry about all of that if we had a mechanism to pass a licence URL to a licence service and let &lt;em&gt;it&lt;/em&gt; sort it out - authenticate the user, then authorize data access or not based on their membership of a group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I spoke John Chodacki from the  &lt;a href="https://cdlib.org/"&gt;Califormnia Digital Library&lt;/a&gt;, standing in for Maria Praetzellis, talked about some work they're doing with field research stations and data management plans, using a Data Management Planning tool called DMPTool. One of Maria's slides showed a graph of how a data management plan links to publications, organisations, funders, datasets and you guessed it, &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt;, identified with standard researcher IDs - ORCIDs. Given that applications like DMPTool, and our home-grown ReDBox Data Management Platform are keeping track of both researcher (and potentially research participant) cohorts and data deposits - these applications might ALSO be able to do the authentication and authorization steps for other services which provision things; repositories that provision data and workspaces that provision services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My final slide I had prepared was about the need for cohort or group management services so we can give groups of people a license to access certain data. I have been sketching out potential software architectures for a couple of client projects that deal with this at internet-scale via standard ways of treating licences, it is worth exploring how that group management could be  developed in Data Management (Planning) applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The talk&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RDMPs need to be useful. There are a couple of dimensions to this - without using the dreaded “Carrot and stick” metaphor they can be useful in that they help you comply with organizational and funder requirements, but also, they could be useful as a focal point for getting access to services.&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers access grants database which indicates which grants they ‘own’ or have access to.  This “surrounding” metadata is registered with the metadata db.
Space marked with this metadata is provisioned on dropbox-like storage which is visible to the NeCTAR cloud – this space should belong to a project, not a person.
Automated and manual ingest processes feed data to this store, harvesting additional metadata where possible and relevant
Provisioned space should be as dropbox like as possible.
Storage is immediately visible to NeCTAR cloud and processes developed to ship data to local HPC or peak facilities using existing high-speed networks and tools
Once project is complete, the data is packaged and shipped to and indexed by the relevant domain repository as well as registered with the RDA index.

&lt;p&gt;This is a slide sent to me by Ian Duncan from the ARDC “Data Lifecycle” project, circa 2016. Note the box top left labelled “Provisioning” - this was an exciting vision which we picked up and implemented at UTS. We added provisioning services to the open source RedBox research data management platform that heard about from Andrew Brazzati who talked just before me, which are now available to the whole community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Data Lifecycle project ”morphed into” (Ian’s Words)  the  &lt;a href="https://www.raid.org.au/"&gt;Research Activity Identifier Service&lt;/a&gt; offered by ARDC - this addresses part, but not all of the Data Lifecycle vision - being able to identify activities is OK but what we really need is a way for cohorts of researchers, their support staff and other participants to be able to access resources. I’ll come back to this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t include this in my presentation - but two of the other presenters did! It was drawn by Gerrad Barthelot at UTS following an architecture workshop with the eResearch team - building on the idea of Provisioning as the core useful service - which we learned about partly from the Data Lifecycle project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Research Data Lifecycles - recently &lt;a href="http://ptsefton.com/2021/04/07/rdmpic/index.html"&gt;I blogged a bit of a rant about the misuse of the term &amp;quot;lifecycle&amp;quot; and called out some issues with some of the ways research data cycles are often depicted as project-based cycles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a diagram that Marco La Rosa and I have been developing that tries to capture the infrastructure needed for Research Data Management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the key points of this diagram is that the  cyclical part of doing FAIR data management should be as rapid as possible, not something to be thought about only at the end of the project. We need to start thinking of &amp;quot;workspaces&amp;quot; as ephemeral places to collect/create, analyse and describe data and push that data into managed repository storage ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you accept this premise, then I think the thing you have to do as a data manager or custodian is work out where all these pieces are - do you have a DMP system yet? Is there a data repository at your institution? There's no point in having data policies or running training unless these bits of infrastructure are in place. And they often aren't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am an independent agent now - since the position of eResearch Support Manager was considered to be redundant by UTS. At least for now I am in a position to work on what &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; want to work on; for me that means looking for gaps - things that need doing in the research sector.  This next couple of slides  is not so much - what can you expect from infrastructure as in expect to be able to get right now, but what infrastructure we need to demand, to support, to ask institutions and projects like the Australian Research Data Commons to support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

RO-Crate
' title='7' border='1'  width='85%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One area I'm putting time into is standardization for data interchange, particularly standardizing ways for turning piles of amorphous data into well described, packaged Digital Objects that can be Reused and moved between Interoperable systems (the I and R in FAIR) - via the &lt;a href="https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/"&gt;RO-Crate spec&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RO-Crate is a method for describing a dataset as a (FAIR) Digital Object using a &lt;strong&gt;single linked-data metadata document&lt;/strong&gt; that can be put in a zip file or download. This is a key enabler for infrastructure that allows for Interop; the I in FAIR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RO-Crate is seeing strong uptake in some communities and is being built in to systems such as &lt;a href="https://about.workflowhub.eu/How-to-make-a-workflow-RO-crate/"&gt;Workflow Hub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://news.aarnet.edu.au/from-endangered-languages-to-the-science-mesh-australian-researchers-are-helping-to-design-and-build-next-gen-petascale-fair-data-repositories/"&gt;PARADISEC&lt;/a&gt; and a new project I'm going to be involved in for Humanities and Social Science Data in Australia - more on that soon. And via the European Open Science Cloud (see the next slide).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example of something Marco and I have been working on (via connections with AARNet) - the CS3MESH4EOSC - is “Democratising FAIR” by helping to link the pink “workspaces” box with the green “repositories” box in our RDM diagram.&lt;/p&gt;

A number of smiley faces representing people grouped into three overlapping cohorts.
&lt;p&gt;' title='9' border='1'  width='85%'/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t have a good way to define groups of people across institutional boundaries which is an essential part of provisioning services to research projects and provisioning non-open data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As noted above - Research Data Management (Planning) Tools could be one part of the infrastructure needed to identity data licences, who holds that licence - meaning that repositories that know the license for data can hand-off authorization and authentication to the DMP system. John Chodacki encouraged me to feed these ideas and requirements into DMPTool process, lets consider this post the first step in that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven McEachern from the Australian Data Archive and I also promised to follow up on the issue of data access/licencing.&lt;/p&gt;

We learned some things, got better at performing for the phone camera and our microphones and better at mixing and publishing the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Disclosure Gail's my wife. We got married; she proposed, I &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Ct0RQv6hiN8"&gt;accepted&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Ct0RQv6hiN8"&gt;I may I might - Is this the world's best marriage proposal acceptance song?&lt;/a&gt; (It did win a prize at a Ukulele festival for best song)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This post is littered with links to our songs, sorry but there are 58 of them and &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; has to link to them.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second quarter of 2020 Gail McGlinn and I went from playing and singing in community music events (jams, gigs, get togethers) at least once a week to being at home every evening, like everyone else.  Like lots of people we decided to put our efforts into home recording, not streaming cos that would be pointless for people with basically no audience, but we started making videos and releasing them under our band name &lt;a href="http://teamhappyband.com/"&gt;Team Happy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By release I mean &amp;quot;put on Facebook&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;sometimes remember to upload to YouTube&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is about that experience and what we learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Team Happy is the name we use to perform as a duo at open mic events and the odd community or ukulele festival. We were originally called &amp;quot;The Narrownecks&amp;quot; in honour of &lt;a href="https://www.visitnsw.com/destinations/blue-mountains/katoomba-area/katoomba/attractions/narrow-neck-lookout"&gt;where we live&lt;/a&gt;, for one gig, but then we found out there's another group with that name. Actually they're much better than us, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1676961009053252"&gt;just go watch them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming in to 2020 we already had a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4yZaVNUQp5iXCojJcT2rjA"&gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; and it had a grand total of two videos on it with a handful of views - as in you could count them on your fingers. It's still a sad thing to behold, how many views we have - but it's not about views it's about getting discovered and having our songs performed by, oh I dunno, Casey Chambers? Keith Urban? (Oh yeah, that would mean we'd need views. Bugger.) Either that or it's about our personal journey and growth as people. Or continuing to contribute to our local music communities in lockdown (which is what Gail says it's about.). Seriously though, we think &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N0HbdJZsgk"&gt;I called your name&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHc3JpDdw8Y"&gt;Dry Pebbles&lt;/a&gt; would go well on someone else's album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, in late March we got out our recording gear and started. While phone cameras are fine for the quality of video we need, we wanted to do better than phone-camera sound. (Here's an example of that sound from one of our first recordings on my song &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ceePoxf0_4"&gt;Seventeen&lt;/a&gt; - it's pretty muddy, like the lighting.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="video-container"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial attempts to get good audio involved feeding USB-audio from a sound mixer with a built in audio interface  (a Yamaha MX10) into the phone itself and recording an audio track &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; the video - but this is clunky and you only get two tracks even though the mixer has multiple inputs. We soon graduated to using a DAW - a Digital Audio Workstation with our mixer, still only two tracks but much less mucking around with the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is more or less what we ended up with for the first few weeks - We'd record or &amp;quot;track&amp;quot; everything on the computer and then use it again to mix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/png/XL9VQy8m47-_Jt7uBgvzb36KpSh0CfdCROz7csfOcfGaLc7ik--QLYajOnJAvVVdBlSZ00ldoVfJgS2Ap9C-A86JHwhyoOe9VlVHxT7eWFr07zxBN1XCf6AE7DOoPyb0ayeCeq2NKM27P3p1mCPZyY8ipl1PUs4BoiGSFwca8s6wZku-taBJLZIqRdWBK-5vXg-2AXOyBT_dN6V6vkWjPLykk9KVMNSyZ9TQdd9fWeQQAiZuW_-dy8qw3-aSwoQYRbRCNORnl6WbjS2K7C-L-e0xOMlPxBfXkss3SwFa4wb9uVxMlAXPyhUckQENNWdNgVr8dYJfThKERD6HPOJJt9przA6D6Sfu08J_3UCqho43rrUu3GF26y9fYpBCoG04hjSW1eRxPmHe_lTyAbqehoIlFCVLfJBM0zStk82Yw8ayB8JEcrSElm00"/&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;Our first-generation recording rig with annoying recording via a laptop&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a thing you have to do to audio files called &lt;em&gt;mastering&lt;/em&gt; which means getting them to a suitable volume level and dynamic range for distribution. Without it loud stuff is too quiet and quiet stuff is too quiet, and the music has no &lt;em&gt;punch&lt;/em&gt;. This was a complete mystery to me to start with so I paid for online services that use AI to master tracks - kind of but not really making everything louder. At some point I started doing it myself, beginning the long process of learning the mysteries of compression and limiting and saving money. Haven't &lt;em&gt;mastered&lt;/em&gt; it yet, though. Mastering is an actual profession, by the way and I'm not going to reach those heights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, we got a  new bit of gear, the Tascam Model 12 an all in one mixer-recorder-interface that lets you track (that is record tracks) without a computer - much easier to deal with. A bit later we got a Zoom H5 portable recorder with built in mics and a couple of extra tracks for instruments so we can do stuff away from home - this got used on our month-long holiday in March 2021. Well it was almost a month, but there was a Rain Event and we came home a bit early. These machines let you capture tracks, including adding new ones without touching the computer which is a big win as far as I am concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="video-container"&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4_9J4QlnCkw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer;  clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_9J4QlnCkw"&gt;Gail singing Closer to fine&lt;/a&gt; on The Strand in Townsville, in North Queensland, recorded on the H5 and (partly) mixed in the car on holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a bit, and depending on the level of lockdown we'd have guests around to visit and when that was happening, we kept our distance at either end of our long lounge room and used a phone camera and microphone at each end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/png/ZPBFIyCm5CVlxwzuxAI7CPhXPGVPSAiA5iOG1M-XIJMO7oLDju7ulvk-pj4r7hoKyFryahn-ssKJk0-jqU1b6RXzrn8dTxmEhPSJ_1gcsmzdAVi6W0GWco1li6QzCEI5AZ4ZQh988nx1k9Ke-mlEJt1ES4WVRHDyQwGDk5PTtfiYIuyvIZ_RoT9v8JrUFVEcv0OB9wJ6ZE4Ctvmp-71pJLEIZibrBqf8XxdIagoz4km_Klh6hGugU5v-ugeLof78knMfu_QUU1rSZOSPxYIlfSVrwdNHpOZS2Ynu4wId8tIWUPBFaolBDT9Wv5NxuTY9qzqKvzEoETaXqVEys6xkYLOd260od0ftiDFRla0mR1pCHu4ORw7dEUixWVxtclPfZ6EdKBFBW06G_RkNoe08ae1T9g33EUcQMU3cM3iV8AxFSGLLDP02BAKLhT4_"&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;Our second-generation recording rig with stand-alone laptop-free tracking &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new setup made it much easier to do overdubs - capture more stuff into the Model 12 and make videos each time, like on this song of mine &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EezBl_I549o"&gt;They Say Dancing&lt;/a&gt; where I overdubbed guitar and bass over a live track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what did we learn?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perfect is the enemy of Done. Well, we knew that, but if you've decided to release a song every week, even if you're away on a holiday, or there are other things going on then there's no time to obsess over details - you have to get better at getting a useable take quickly or you won't be able to keep going for a year or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practice may not make perfect, but it's a better investment than new gear, or doing endless takes with the cameras rolling. We got better at picking a song (or deciding to write one or finish one off), playing it for a week or two and then getting the take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simplify! We learned that to get a good performance sometimes it was better for only one of us to play or sing, that fancy parts increased the chance of major errors, meaning yet another take. If in doubt (like my harmony singing that's always in doubt) we're learning to leave it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody likes us! Actually we know that's not true, some of the songs get  hundreds of plays on Facebook but not many people actually click the like button, maybe twenty or so. But then you run into people in the supermarket; they say &amp;quot;love the songs keep it up&amp;quot;! And there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; quite a few people who listen every week on FB we just can't tell they're enjoying it. There are complex reasons for this lack of engagement - some people don't like to like things so that (they think) the evil FB can't track them. I think the default auto-play for video might be a factor too - the video starts playing, and that might not be a good time, so people skip forward to something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's kind of demoralizing that it is MUCH easier to get likes with pictures of the dog.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;div class="figure"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our spoiled covid-hound, Floki - about 18 months old. Much more &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt;able on the socials than our music.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YouTube definitely doesn't like us. I figured that some of the songs we sang would attract some kind of Youtube audience - we often search to see what kinds of covers of songs are out there and thought others might find us the same way, but we get almost no views on that platform. I also thought that adding some text about the gear we used might bring in some views. For example we were pretty early adopters of the Tascam Model 12. I had tried to find out what one sounded like in real life before I bought, with no success - and I thought people might drop by to hear us, but I don't think Google/YouTube is giving us any search-juice at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Our personal favourites&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Favourite cover we did (and we actually agreee on this - Team Happy is NOT an ironic name) was &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQeS4fSSu7k"&gt;Colour my World&lt;/a&gt;. We'd just got the Tascam and Gail was able to double track herself - no mucking around with computers. We had fun that night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="video-container"&gt;

&lt;div class="caption"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQeS4fSSu7k"&gt;Colour my World&lt;/a&gt; - one of our fave covers to perform&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And my favourite original? Well i'm very proud of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnfcJGVVVhU"&gt;All L'Amour for you&lt;/a&gt; with lots of words and a bi-lingual pun - I wanted to do that on the local community radio just last weekend when we were asked in, but the host Richard 'Duck' Keegan kind of mentioned the aforementioned &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N0HbdJZsgk"&gt;I Called Your Name&lt;/a&gt; so we did that instead along with &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHc3JpDdw8Y"&gt;Dry Pebbles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ceePoxf0_4"&gt;Seventeen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gail's fave original? &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Ct0RQv6hiN8"&gt;I may I might&lt;/a&gt;, the song that snagged her the best husband in South Katoomba over 1.95m tall. And she likes the tear jerker &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkfbSeDXUVo"&gt;Goodbye Mongrel dog&lt;/a&gt; I wrote, on which she pays some pumpin' banjo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="caption"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkfbSeDXUVo"&gt;Goodbye Mongrel dog&lt;/a&gt; - a song that says goodbye to a (deceased) Mongrel dog who went by the name of Spensa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Music-tech stuff and mixing tips&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who care, here's a roundup of the main bits of kit that work well. We've reached the point where there's actually nothing on the shopping list - we can do everything for the foreseeable future with what we have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have mentioned that we track using the Tascam Model 12 and the Zoom H5 - these are both great. The only drawback of the Zoom is that you can't see the screen (and thus the levels) from performance position. It also needed a better wind shield - I bought a dead-cat, shaggy thing to go over the mics that works if the wind is moderate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I bought the Tascam I thought it was going to be all analogue through the mixer stage like their Model 16 and Model 24, but no, it's all digital. I don't think this is an issue having used it but it was not something they made all that explicit at launch. There's a digital Zoom equivalent (the L12) which is a bit smaller, and has more headphone outputs but at the expense of having to do mode-switching to to access all the functions. I think the Tascam will be easier to use for live shows when those start happening again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For video we just use our phones - for a while we had matching Pixel 4XLs then a Pixel 5 which drowned in a tropical stream. Yes they're waterproof, those models, but not when they have tiny cracks in the screen. No more $1000 phones for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reaper.fm/"&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt; is bloody marvelous software. It's cheap for non-commercial use, incredibly powerful and extensible. I have not used any other Digital Audio Workstation other than Garage Band, that comes for free on the Apple Platform but as far as I can see there's no reason for non-technophobic home producers to pay any more than the Reaper fee for something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our mainstay mics are a slightly battered pair of &lt;a href="https://www.soundonsound.com/reviews/audio-technica-at2020"&gt;Audio Technica AT2020&lt;/a&gt;s - we had these for performing live with Gail's band U4ria - everyone gathered around a condenser mic, bluegrass style. For recording we either put one at either end of the room or mount them vertically in an X/Y configuration - 90° to get stereo. They're fairly airy and have come to be a big part of our sound. We tried some other cheap things that didn't work very well, and I got a pair of Australian &lt;a href="https://www.soundonsound.com/reviews/rode-m5"&gt;Rode M5&lt;/a&gt; pencil condenser mics, not expensive, that I hoped might be easier to mount X/Y but we didn't like them for vocals at all, though they're great on stringed instruments. We do have an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shure_SM58"&gt;SM58&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shure_SM57"&gt;SM57&lt;/a&gt; -- gotta love a microphone with a wikipedia page -- which see occasional use as vocal mics if we want a more rock 'n roll sound, or the guest singer is more used to a close-mic. And the SM57 for guitar amps sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tend to play our favourite acoustic instruments but when we have bass we use the Trace Elliot Elf amp which has a great compressor and a DI output (it can send a signal to the mixer/interface without going via the speaker). Sometimes we run the speaker and try not to let it bleed too much into the AT2020s, very occasionally we wear headphones for the first track and go direct so there's no bass bleed. I have done a bit of electric guitar with the Boss Katana 50 - to me it sounds good in the room that amp, but has not recorded well either via the headphone out or via an SM57. I get better results thru the bass amp. I don't have any kind of actual electric guitar &lt;em&gt;tone&lt;/em&gt; sorted though I have seen lot of videos about how to achieve the elusive &lt;em&gt;tone&lt;/em&gt;. Maybe one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that I wasn't expecting to happen - I dropped the top E of my little Made in Mexico Martin OOO Jr guitar to D (you know, like Keef) some time early in 2020 and it ended up staying there. Gives some nice new chord voicings (9ths mostly) and it's the same top 4 strings as a 5 string banjo with some very easy-to-grab chords. Have started doing it to Ukuleles too, putting them in open C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A note on the bass:&lt;/strong&gt;  Playing bass is fun (we knew that before we started) but mixing it so it can be heard on a phone speaker is a real challenge. One approach that helps is using an acoustic bass which  out of a lot more high frequency than a solid body electric this also helps because you don't have to have an amp on while you're tracking it live, but you can take a direct input from a pickup (or two) AND mic the bass giving you lots of signals with different EQ to play with.  I gaffa-taped a guitar humbucker into my Artist Guitars 5 string acoustic and it sounds &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic (ha!) trick I try to use for getting more high frequency for tiny speakers is to create a second track, saturate the signal with distortion and/or saturation effects to boost the upper harmonic content and then cut all the low frequency out and mix that so it can &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; be heard and &lt;em&gt;imply&lt;/em&gt; the fundamental bass frequency in addition to the real bassy bass. Helps if you have some bridge pickup or under-saddle pickup in the signal if those are available and if you remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also like to add some phaser effect that gives some motion in the upper frequencies - for example my &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItqXJ1zsvqg"&gt;Perfect Country Pop Song&lt;/a&gt; - too much phaser? Probably, but I can hear the bass on my phone and it &lt;em&gt;bounces&lt;/em&gt; :). Phaser is Team Happy's favourite effect, nothing says perfect country pop (which is what we are, right?) like a phaser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="video-container"&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ItqXJ1zsvqg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer;  clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItqXJ1zsvqg"&gt;Perfect Country Pop Song&lt;/a&gt; - is it perfect or merely sublime? (This one has a cute puppy in it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything I know about music production is from YouTube. Everything I know about song writing is from deep in my soul. Thank you for reading all the way to the bottom. Normal service will resume next week.&lt;/p&gt;

We're having a workshop about Open CourseWare (OCW <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> AKA Open Educational Resources or OERs)
here at USQ soon, organised by [<span>Michael
Sankey</span>](http://www.usq.edu.au/users/sankey/). I'd like us to talk
about some of the potential costs and benefits of going OER from the
points of view of Students, Staff and the University as well as the
external stakeholders, independent learners (potential students of USQ)
and our broader society. I'll post on that soon.\
In this post I want to mention my two favourite objections to going
open, which come up every time I start talking (ranting?) about OCW and
OERs at USQ.

1.  If we release our best stuff then that's the **end of our
    business!**<span style="font-weight:normal; "><span class="T5">
    </span></span>

2.  And if we expose **poor quality courseware**, won't that hurt our
    brand?

There are other more legitimate concerns like the amount of copyright
material that is embedded in our materials; both licensed stuff, and
stuff that is not licensed properly. Actually, the licensed stuff
represents an opportunity, and with the unlicensed we really don't know
the scale of the problem, if there is a problem at all. I'll return to
this issue. But now for those two objections.

Let in the sunlight I say.

# <span id="id3"></span><span></span></a>The sky is falling!

My favourite frequently heard objection is that somehow our enrolment
revenue depends on keeping our high-value course materials locked up. I
like it because it encapsulates so many assumptions that need to be
challenged. This one came up again when I was talking to a very senior
USQ person, as-in reports to the Vice Chancellor kind of senior. It went
something like this:

> educational resources have to be open, the way we are starting to see
> in the research space. The government is paying us to write this
> stuff, they might like to reduce the amount of redundant work in the
> same way they don't want to pay for the same old research more than
> once, they want to pay for new research.
>
> **X:** Oh. If that happens we can kiss our business goodbye. That's

From there we moved into the broader discussion about how going open
might work as a 'business' model.

Come the revolution, we'll get over this 'business' stuff.

Note that I don't believe for a minute that OERs and self directed
learning would kill-off the traditional high-touch models we use now,
although they will probably erode them more than a bit in some circles,
notably with postgrad learners, I'm just following through the argument
that keeps coming up about why we can't release our stuff, because when
you follow it through, the conclusion has to be **release early and
learn** rather than cower in fear and hope you've retired before things
change too much.

# <span id="id4"></span><span></span></a>The cost of the current attitude

Above, I was really talking about two fears:

1.  **Fear of exposure** <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> I have
    usually heard this directed at other people's materials.

2.  **Lack of confidence in what it says in our strategy**, that USQ is
    a relationship brand and we are all about the student experience
    that we can deliver to our largely-off campus learners.

    (cf MIT's confidence that releasing its curriculum materials (not
    distance stuff <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> at least not so
    far, but read on) and video lecturers doesn't undermine the MIT
    experience. And [<span>happy tenth anniversary
    OCW@MIT!</span>](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/329/5991/525))

This attitude that sharing is too risky, lives hand-in-hand with the
fear that getting any substantial change in policy, and getting the
grass roots support from teachers is going to be too hard. And this
attitude is costing us, NOW.

I wrote a about this recently, [<span>Cheap laugh \#1. Suggest opening
up courseware just a
little.</span>](http://ptsefton.com/2010/05/17/cheap-laugh-1-suggest-opening-up-courseware-just-a-little.htm)
That piece was about opening up access to all our courseware to all our
students, so they could, like, see what we had and you know, enrol in
things, thus bringing us **revenue**, and revise prerequisite subjects
they may or may not have done thus improving their result, **improving
our retention rate**. With many other colleagues, I am trying to get
these ideas considered, but it's hard work.

The good news is that ADFI's new Executive Director, Prof Gilly Salmon,
who will start in January 2011, reports that at Leicester where she's
currently working, once OERs got started, lots of objections and fears
melted away. I'm sure she'll join us in pushing (at least trials of)
OERs at USQ.

Finally note that MIT is going to start creating the kinds of OERs that
are USQ's core territory:

> This fall, OCW will begin to introduce course materials designed<span
> class="T6"> </span>specifically for use by independent learners, which
> will include<span class="T6"> </span>complete sets of content,
> increased focus on problem-solving,<span class="T6"> </span>and
> additional self-assessment opportunities. Through these<span
> class="T6"> </span>and other pilot programs, the OCW team hopes to
> develop a better<span class="T6"> </span>understanding of how to
> increase the benefits for this varied<span class="T6"> </span>global
> audience.

Now we can all be afraid. There goes our business!

<span lang="en-US">I was invited to speak at the </span>[National Higher
Education Faculty Research Summit in Sydney on May
22](http://apo.org.au/content/national-higher-education-faculty-research-summit-2013)<span

<span lang="en-US">My topic </span>is “Introducing a data deposit
management plan to the research community at UWS”. This relates directly
to the conference theme I have highlighted, on emerging tools and
practice. My strategy for this presentation, given that we’re at a
summit, is to stay above 8000m, use a few metaphors, and discuss the
strategy we’re taking at UWS rather than dive too deeply into the sordid
details of projects. As usual, these are my notes; I hope these few
paragraphs will be more useful than just a slide deck, but this is not a
fully developed essay.

## There are two kinds of data: Working and Archival/Published

![](/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/wpid-Research-Data.html_Research-Data_html_1e9e85bc.png)

</section>
In very general terms, we have divided our data storage into two parts:
the working Research Data Storage service where people get things done,
collect data and work with it and the archival Research Data Repository
part where stable, citable published data sets are looked after (by the
library) for the long term.

This talk is not going to be all about architecture diagrams but here’s
one more, from a [recent project
update](http://eresearch.uws.edu.au/blog/2013/05/09/research-data-repository-rdr-progress-report-may-2013/)
showing two examples of applications that will assist researchers in
working with data. One very important application is [HIEv, the central
data capture/management platform for the Hawkesbury Institute for the
Environment](http://eresearch.uws.edu.au/blog/projects/data-capture-for-climate-change-and-energy-research/).
This is where research teams capture sensor data, research support staff
work to clean and package the data, researchers develop models and
produce derived data and visualisations. We’re still working out exactly
how this will work as publications using the data start to flow, but
right now data moves from the working space to the archival space, and
thence to the national data discovery service, see this example of
[weather
data](http://researchdata.ands.org.au/automatic-weather-station-data-collected-at-the-university-of-western-sydneys-hawkesbury-institute-for-the-environment-field-facility-based-in-richmond-nsw-during-the-period-june-2011-to-march-2013)
– (unfortunately the data set is not yet openly available for this one,
I think it should be, and I’ll be doing what I can to make it so).

## Data wrangling services

![](/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/wpid-Research-Data.html_Research-Data_html_6478c395.png)

</section>
The other service shown on this diagram is Dropbox.com. We’d be hard
pressed to stop researchers from using this service – it comes up in
just about every consultation meeting. Researchers themselves must take
responsibility for making sure that services like this are appropriate
given their data management obligations under funder agreements and
codes of practice. For those projects where Dropbox.com *is* appropriate
we plan to let researchers invite the Research Data Store to share their
stuff, thus creating a managed, backed-up copy at the university, and
opening the way for us to provide useful services over the data (coming
soon).

## Data [management](http://www.uws.edu.au/research/researchers/data_management)

</section>
Yes, we have a web page about research data management, with some basic
advice and links to more resources, but putting up web pages does not
effect the kind of culture change needed to establish research data
management, data re-use and data citation. As our Research Office head,
Gar Jones, says this will be a change similar to the introduction of
Human and Animal ethics management which will take several years to roll
out.

## Some key points for this presentation

I want to talk about:

-   Governance, open access, metadata, identifiers

-   The importance of the (administrative) research lifecycle

-   Policy supported by services rather than aspirations

## eResearch = goat tracks

## ![](/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/wpid-Research-Data.html_Research-Data_html_30963b55.jpg)

</section>
This is a concrete path on the Werrington South (Penrith) campus of the
University of Western Sydney. The path is there because people kept
walking through the garden bed, which was in between where the shuttle
bus stops and where they wanted to be, at the library. As [I said at a
similar conference for IT-types last
year](http://ptsefton.com/2012/09/12/virtual-infrastructure-and-research-support-fostering-collaboration-across-institutions.htm):

> Groups like mine work in the gap between the concrete and the goat
> track, my job is to encourage the goats.

And once we’ve encouraged the goats to make new paths, we need to get
the university infrastructure people to come and pave the paths.

## What’s over the horizon?

![](/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/wpid-Research-Data.html_Research-Data_html_66d08499.jpg)

</section>
What do research administrators and IT directors need to be thinking
about?

-   Changes in the research landscape – more emphasis on data reuse and
    citation, increasing emphasis on defensible research mean data will
    become as important as citations

-   Providing access to publications and data so it can be reused.

-   (e)Research infrastructure in general, where collaboration must not
    be constrained by the boundaries of individual institutional
    networks and firewalls.

Any others?

## Governments are [joining in](http://data.gov.au/)

![](/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/wpid-Research-Data.html_Research-Data_html_5861e9e3.png)

</section>
As research organisations, we want to have infrastructure for data
management, and a culture of data management that involves forward
planning, and data re-use. So the next section of the talk is about how
we need to:

-   Stop the fat multinational-publisher tail from wagging the starving
    research dog. Ensure research funded by us is accessible and usable
    by us.

-   Understand our researchers and their habits, so we can help them
    take on this new data management responsibility (actually it’s not a
    new responsibility, but many have simply been paying no attention to
    it, in the absence of any obvious reason to do so).

-   Sort out the metadata mess most universities are swimming in.

There are competing models for open access. Bizarrely the discussion is
often framed as a contest between ‘Green’ and ‘Gold’. It’s a lot like
the State of Origin Rugby League, a contrived but
popular-in-obscure-corners of the world contest where the ‘Blues’ and
‘Maroons’ run repeatedly into each other. In both State of Origin and
Open Access, the current winners are large media companies. Add least
being an Open Access advocate doesn’t give you head injuries.

*Green* OA refers to author-deposited pre-publication versions of
research articles. *Gold* means that the published version itself is
‘Open’ for some ill-defined definition of open, often at a cost of
thousands of dollars, out of the researcher’s budget. Green or Gold, a
lot of so-called Open Access publishing operates with no formal legal
underpinnings, that is, without copyright-based licenses. For example
when I deposited a Green version of a paper I had written here, and
wrote to the publisher [asking them to clarify copyright and licensing
issues I got no
reply](http://ptsefton.com/2009/08/19/towards-scholarly-html.htm).

\
We have a brief window now to try to build services for research data
management that do have a solid legal basis and avoid following some of
the OA movements missteps but this is not trivial (1).

## Identity management is crucial

![](/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/wpid-Research-Data.html_Research-Data_html_20cb366a.png)

</section>
I have used a variant of the above dog picture before to talk [about
identity
management](http://www.slideshare.net/ptsefton1/a-hint-ofmint/8). This
dog has a name but it’s a terrible way to find out about him as he has a
[much more famous
namesake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootsy_Collins).

Like the rest of us, this dog has all sorts of identifying names and
numbers – a microchip number linked to a database, an ID assigned by the
RSPCA, patient numbers at veterinary practices, which may be linked to
more than one human, phone numbers on his tag etc. Point is, it’s much
worse for researchers than for dogs – identities are maintained all over
the place. Foley and <span lang="en-US">Kochalko put it like
this:</span>

> While much has changed since the days of David Livingstone, we
> continue to struggle with associating individuals with their works
> accurately and unambiguously. Author name ambiguity plagues science
> and scholarship: when researchers are not properly identified and
> credited for their work, dead-ends and information gaps emerge. The
> impact ripples throughout the ecosystem, compromising collaboration
> networks, impact metrics, “smarter” research allocations, and the
> overall discovery process. Name ambiguity also weighs on the system by
> creating significant hidden costs for all stakeholders. (2)

\
To do metadata management well we need to make sure that we sort out all
sorts of naming and identifying issues, dealing correctly with potential
causes of confusion, multiple people with the same name, people with
multiple names over time, and simultaneously, name variants. Even where
there are agreed subject codes like the Field of Research codes that are
heavily used in research measurement exercises they can get mixed us as
different databases use different variants.

## We try to work out how to fit new processes into existing workflows

![](/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/wpid-Research-Data.html_Research-Data_html_7e60e83b.png)

</section>
At Rochester university, when they installed an institutional repository
the team conducted ethnographic research on their research community
(3). We have not gone that far, but our Research Data Repository project
does try to pay attention to what researchers *do* as part of their
current work, and to fit new processes into existing ones.

\
For example, the above scenario tries to capture the interactions that
would happen when a researcher is required by a journal to deposit data
before publication. We spend a lot of time talking to the Office of
Research Services (ORS) and research librarian team about how we can fit
in with their existing processes, and how to minimise negative impacts
on research groups. Research Offices are used to responding to changing
regulatory environments so adding new fields to forms etc is
straightforward. Changing IT services is much harder; the ITS is much
bigger than ORS, new services need to be acquired, provisioned and
documented, and the service desk team has to be taught new processes.

## Challenge: how to stop the corporate publishing tail from wagging the scholarly dog

![](/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/wpid-Research-Data.html_Research-Data_html_m3505a486.jpg)

</section>
This is a rather a substantial issue to try to talk about in a
discussion about research data management and repositories, but it’s
essential to keep an eye on the big picture. We know that scholarship
has to change, publishing has to change, but we don’t know how. We need
to develop strategies for how we want it to change. Some examples of
where this is important:

-   Policy on ‘ownership’ of intellectual property rights over data
    needs to be established. This is not as simple as it is for
    publications, as data are not always subject to copyright (1).

-   Data citation is going to be an important metric.

New models are needed. People like Alex Holcombe from Sydney uni are
developing them:

> Science is broken; let’s fix it. This has been my mantra for some
> years now, and today we are launching an initiative aimed squarely at
> one of science’s biggest problems. The problem is called publication
> bias or the file-drawer problem and it’s resulted in what some [have
> called a replicability
> crisis](http://pps.sagepub.com/content/7/6/528.short).
>
> When researchers do a study and get negative or inconclusive results,
> those results usually end up in file drawers rather than published.
> When this is true for studies attempting to replicate
> already-published findings, we end up with a replicability crisis
> where people don’t know which published findings can be trusted.
>
> To address the problem, [Dan Simons](http://www.dansimons.com/) and I
> are introducing a new article format at the journal *Perspectives on
> Psychological Science (PoPS)*. The new article format is
> called [Registered Replication
> Reports](http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/replication) (RRR).
>  The process will begin with a psychological scientist interested in
> replicating an already-published finding. They will explain to we
> editors why they think replicating the study would be worthwhile
> (perhaps it has been widely influential but had few or no published
> replications). If we agree with them, they will be invited to submit a
> methods section and analysis plan and submit it to we editors. The
> submission will be sent to reviewers, preferably the authors of the
> original article that was proposed to be replicated. These reviewers
> will be asked to help the replicating authors ensure their method is
> nearly identical to the original study.  The submission will at that
> point be accepted or rejected, and the authors will be told to report
> back when the data comes in.  The methods will also be made public and
> other laboratories will be invited to join the replication attempt.
>  All the results will be posted in the end, with a meta-analytic
> estimate of the effect size combining all the data sets (including the
> original study’s data if it is available). The Open Science
> Framework [website](http://openscienceframework.org/) will be used to
> post some of this. The press release
> is [here](http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/news/releases/initiative-on-research-replication.html),
> and the details can be found [at the PoPS

<a name="_GoBack"></a> This seems like a positive note on which to end.
Hundreds of researchers are trying to fix scholarship, they’re the ones
we need to talk to about what a data repository or a data management
plan should be.

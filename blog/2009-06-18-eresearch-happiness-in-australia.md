I have [posted here before about work at
ADFI](http://ptsefton.com/2009/06/03/eresearch-at-adfi-as-summary-and-potential-projects.htm)
that may be of interest to [ANDS](http://www.ands.org.au/index.html).

After a recent visit to Canberra I have another couple of ideas
presented here in a very quick blog post.

# <span id="id1"></span><!--id1--></a>1 An implementation fund for CAIRSS

Currently we run [CAIRSS](http://cairss.caul.edu.au/www/) as a support
service, but as some of our discussions with stakeholders move along I
foresee a time when people will start to say stuff like <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>[we need a normalizing OAI-PMH
proxy](http://ptsefton.com/2008/10/20/towards-australian-repository-interoperability-using-oia-pmh.htm)<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> (people other than me that is). We could
have a mini project fund administered by the CAIRSS steering committee
or a subcommittee which could dispense funds on the basis of short
proposals. \$1,000,000 over two years would be fine.

# <span id="id2"></span><!--id2--></a>2 A developer engagement project

I have been trying to put my finger on what is lacking in the spread of
projects we have now; ANDS, ARCS, NeAT and the outcomes of previous
things like our own ICE-RS project and the ARCHER and DART projects.
There's lots of good stuff going on but it feels to me like the
community is somewhat fragmented by discipline, or by repository people
vs grid computing people or along other dimensions.

So how about a program to do something like we did on RUBRIC but for
software developers instead of repository managers - and for the new
role of eResearch Analysts around the country.
[RUBRIC](http://rurbic.edu.au/) was Regional Universities Building
Research Infrastructure Collaboratively. This would be
Something-or-other Building Research Infrastructure Collaboratively. The
acronym we can leave to Dr Treloar.

I am basing this suggestion on my experience of what JISC is doing to
build professional networks amongst their developer community by running
competitions alongside conferences, hosting loosely structured meetings
like the [develop happiness days](http://www.dev8d.org/) and so on. So
why don't we hire a few people; one to organize events and
communications and one or more experienced open source developers with
good communication skills (can we clone David Flanders or entice him out
here?) who can promote:

1.  **Community**. Getting developers in touch with each other and with
    the implementers, the eResearch analysts. For example we could
    really use the help of some semantic web people on our work on The
    Fascinator Desktop, do I know who to ask? (Well, actually yes I do,
    but that's just an example).

2.  **Harmony**. Getting teams working in similar areas to work together
    and share rather than re-inventing.

3.  **Openness**. Encourage and assist projects to work with their code
    under an open trunk from day zero so that others can join in at any
    stage and offer assistance, rather than working in a closed
    environment and then (maybe) releasing the code after the project
    has finished and it is **too late for others to offer useful
    assistance**. I won't name names, but some publicly funded software
    that should be open is not and we have had to rewrite it.

4.  **Friendly competition**. I was forced by David Flanders to [enter
    the developer happiness days
    competition](http://openobjects.blogspot.com/2009/02/our-dev8d-lazy-lecturer-prototype.html)
    and made two new connections (hi Mia, hi Ian), and I met [Anna
    Gerber](http://www.itee.uq.edu.au/~agerber/) from down the road at
    UQ partly because I was a judge on the [Developer Challenge at
    OR09](https://or09.library.gatech.edu/challenge.php) and now I will
    take my semantic web questions to her.

    Via Les Carr comes the idea of giving developers hard disks full of
    assorted data and documents and saying 'what can you do with that
    lot'. We could do that at [eResearch
    Australasia](http://www.eresearch.edu.au/) 2009, mix up data from
    the humanities and sciences to encourage discipline specialists to
    work with each other and throw in some documents to get the
    repository people involved.

I have not worked out a budget but to have decent events, travel and
guests from overseas this might need \$1,000,000 or more a year.

We ran into these on a project that I was involved, CR8it, which is a research-data publishing app. The goal of CR8it is to allow users to publish a data set, either openly or in a controlled way to a cohort of their choosing (why they'd want to do this is another discussion, but there are various drivers, including funders encouraging sharing of data, other compliance issues, and a general trend to high-integrity research via good data management). To do this, they need to be able to see their files, select which ones belong in the package, add some metadata, so any-old desktop app could do the job. But there are problems with desktop based apps. They're fairly expensive to build and manage, they require deployment and are either sensitive to operating system upgrades, and in the case of a data-packaging app they may have performance issues with large files or large numbers of files. Also, users are increasing demanding, or at least expecting, dropbox-like **sharing** and **syncing** as a matter of course, so it's worth thinking about how a data packaging app fits into this.

Lets take two examples.

Excite9 is a desktop app.

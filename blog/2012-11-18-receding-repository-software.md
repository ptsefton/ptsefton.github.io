I’m leading a brief session at the CAIRSS community days today (CAIRSS
is the national repository support service for Australasia). The title
is “Emerging Repository Software”, but I thought I’d turn that around
and propose that the future of institutional repositories is to fade
into the background.

Here are my notes for the session.

Take this screenshot of the Griffith University repository. See here’s
the default browse-screen for publications.

## The Griffith Publications repository

## Hold on! That’s not the repository

This is the Research Hub which ties together data from a number of
different sources to provide a joined-up view of publications in the
context of other research information.

## The repository has faded into the background

Much like this invisible dog.

Just in case these Griffith people get big heads, I do have to point out
that while I think this service points to the future of the
Institutional Repository as an embedded part of the research information
systems of the university, the work’s not all done yet.

## But, this is not perfect

The ‘find it yourself’ button is sub-optimal:
![](/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/wpid-Receding_repo-copy.html.html_Receding_repo-copy_filesimage006.png)

And check out this URL:

[http://research-hub.griffith.edu.au/collections\#fq={!tag=classgroup}classgroup%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fresearch-hub.griffith.edu.au%2Findividual%2FvitroClassGroupcollections%22](http://research-hub.griffith.edu.au/collections#fq={!tag=classgroup}classgroup%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fresearch-hub.griffith.edu.au%2Findividual%2FvitroClassGroupcollections%22)

That really should be something like:

This stuff is hard to get right. The hardest bit is getting good quality
metadata so things *do* join up.

There are two new kinds of repository we’re seeing in Australia, thanks
to investment from the Australian National Data Service.

1.  There are many “Data Capture” systems for researchers to manage data
    early in its lifecycle.

2.  These feed into Data Catalogues or Data Repositories – there’s a lot
    of terminological confusion here because of the way the funding
    streams have been structured.

    <section itemscope itemtype="http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide">
    ## Data capture Systems

    See the ANDS [list of DC
    projects](https://projects.ands.org.au/getAllProjects.php?start=dc).
    Here’s one I selected at random:

    ![](/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/wpid-Receding_repo-copy.html.html_Receding_repo-copy_filesimage008.png)

    It’s difficult to get useful information about many of these
    projects.

    </section>

There are many data capture projects, and all of them will presumably
need to be hooked up to systems like the Griffith Research Hub at some
stage.

## Data ~~is~~ are the new black

A few notable projects:

-   Lincoln’s ‘API first’ research data management app,
    [Orbital](http://orbital.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/).

-   [Admiral](http://imageweb.zoo.ox.ac.uk/wiki/index.php/ADMIRAL) at
    Oxford; a two-tier system (capture / archive).

-   Islandora [in a few research data
    contexts](http://www.slideshare.net/d_wilcox/stewarding-research-data-with-islandora).

See JISC’s [Managing Research
Data](http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/~/link.aspx?_id=CA545CC36C54494CA1D5EFAC8C79320A&_z=z)
programme for more.

(I wanted to mention the Hydra Fedora-commons toolkit as well lots of
work on [archives and digital
libraries](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/Partners+and+Implementations)).

## The current opportunity for libraries

Use your metadata skills to help with “the great joining up”.

-   Get the governance right ([see the ANDS view of
    this](http://metadata-stores.blogspot.com.au/2012/08/project-governance-roles-and.html)).

    Research systems are *for* the researchers.

     (So projects should report to the Deputy Vice Chancellor Research).

-   Start working with Research Data – not just on repositories, but on
    *useful* applications.

-   Get involved in tag-and-release programs for the feral data capture
    projects roaming Australia’s universities.

-   Do more work on ‘Digital library’ projects beyond the institutional
    publications repository.

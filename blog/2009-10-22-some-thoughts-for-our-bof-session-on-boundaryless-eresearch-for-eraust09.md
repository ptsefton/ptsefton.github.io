At eResearch Australasia 2009 in November in Sydney, I'm going to to be
co-facilitating a Birds of Feather session with Anna Gerber from UQ, and
Peter Murray-Rust and Jim Downing from Cambridge; Jim Downing will be
involved but he won't be able to join us at Manly. The topic is
[Boundaryless eResearch: use the Web, use Linked Open
Data](http://www.eresearch.edu.au/2009bof05). There's an [extended
abstract in PDF
format](http://www.eresearch.edu.au/docs/2009/era09_submission_68.pdf)
which I'm hoping we can build into a paper. I'm supposed to be starting
that work now, hence this blog post to try to get my thoughts in order.

The three things I most care about for this session are:

1.  **Getting tools into the hands of researchers so they can 'do'
    linked data.** They're never going to read Tim Berners lee's [Design
    Issues](http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html) page or wade
    through a
    [tutorial](http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/bizer/pub/LinkedDataTutorial/)
    so we need to give them tools that help them do their work, back up
    their data, publish data and both informal and formal commentary.
    Right now Linked Data is Too Hard. I think we're going to need some
    online wizard services and other tools that let people do semantic
    web stuff without all the hair-tearing.

    Anna's team, in Jane Hunter's group are [working on this with their
    Firefox Add In for creating compound semantic-web objects, for
    literary
    scholars](http://www.ijdc.net/index.php/ijdc/article/view/116).

2.  **Getting the web into the scholarly communications process as a
    first-class citizen**, as seen over and over on this blog, now
    branded as [Scholarly
    HTML](http://delicious.com/ptsefton/ptsefton+scholarlyhtml). A lot
    of the discussion of Linked data is about giving things names, and
    describing relationships in RDF, but how will real people talk about
    stuff? How will they email and blog and wave at each other, with
    those links embedded inscholarly discourse in a **meaningful** way?

    Meaning matters. It's not enough to link to something; you have to
    be able to indicate why you're linking to it. Am I linking to
    someone to say their an author on this paper? To cite them? Or to
    indicate that I'm talking *about* them.

    I think that working out how linked data fits with documents is very
    important and services like the Australian National Data Service
    ([ANDS](http://ands.edu.au/)) will ignore this dimension at their
    peril. I mean, how are we going to bootstrap the data-citation
    economy if we don't think about documents? That's, like, where
    people cite things.

3.  **Bringing the web to the desktop.** Linked Data is all about the
    web but desktop operating systems are still mainly web consumers and
    it's not easy to move desktop or lab generated stuff to the web; the
    work we're doing with [The
    Fascinator](http://fascinator.usq.edu.au/) and Jim's team is doing
    with [Lensfield](http://code.google.com/p/lensfield/) is trying to
    let people see all their stuff (including data and documents) as
    part of the web from the moment they create it, by providing a
    web-view of local files which is integrated into a system that can
    move stuff to repositories, and publish, and back things up, and
    serve as a platform for analytical tools.

Here are my notes from the [lighting
talk](http://code.google.com/p/developerhappinessdays/wiki/LightningTalks)
'beyond PDF' at the developer happiness days. There's [a video
online](http://dev8d.jiscinvolve.org/2009/02/11/lightning-talk-beyond-the-pdf/)
<span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> I haven't watched it but I imagine
it's the usual incoherent ranting, apparently with added sound quality
issues, not to mention a touch of jetlag.

The intention was to:

1.  Explain the big issue: we're not realizing the potential of the web
    for eLearning and eResearch when lots of academic work is happening
    in anti-web systems like MS Office.

2.  Demo the ICE system for a technical perspective to show developers
    how it might make them happy.

3.  Rant about how technical people need to do more to help their
    academic communities. Why are we pissing around with twitter and
    building repository infrastructure while thousands of PhD candidates
    aren't using styles to structure their thesis?

# Beyond PDF?

The problem:

-   HTML is only accessible to most people in toy-scale applications
    like blogs or small pages in learning system.

-   Services like repositories and VLEs don't typically deal with word
    processing documents at all well.

-   Word processor vendors largely gave up on HTML export years ago.

-   But a large amount of academic content is still made in Word.

# What am I doing about it?

-   Spent the past 13 years designing Word templates and [associated
    infrastructure](http://ice.usq.edu.au/) and handing them out to the
    needy.

-   Spend a lot of time trying to get large companies to care about the
    web for their word processing users. In the last year I have talked
    to Microsoft, Google, Adobe & Sun. Guess which one is the most open
    to discussion, use the comments.

-   Trying to help with other open source projects like
    [Zotero](http://zotero.org/) [OJS](http://pkp.sfu.ca/?q=ojs) and
    [OpenOffice.org](http://openoffice.org/).

-   Now working with PhD candidates to help them change scholarly
    publishing from the ground up.

-   What are you doing?

    (I know David Flanders is doing stuff with Google Docs)

# Some demos

-   The I[CE
    toolbar](http://ice.usq.edu.au/instructions/templates/toolbars_and_templates.htm),
    Surreptitiously doing the right thing.

-   Rapid feedback systems. Type in the word processor / refresh in the
    browser.

-   Lots of integration points <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span>
    push to LMS, blogs and repositories.

-   Web services for
    [conversion](http://ice-service.usq.edu.au/api/convert). (RESTish
    but not formally RESTful enough <span
    class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> we'd better work on that.)

-   Points to cover: embedded semantics
    ([chem](http://ptsefton.com/blog/2007/06/22/cml_demo/),
    [geo](http://ptsefton.com/2008/06/19/adventures-in-geocoding-part-2-embedding-data-points-in-documents.htm)),
    generic structure,

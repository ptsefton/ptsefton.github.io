I'm so happy. OpenOffice.org is getting a [brand
makeove](http://www.openoffice.org/trademark/brandrefresh.html)r! Those
seagulls mean so much to me, and will mean so much more in the new
friendlier blue with added Oracle<span class="spCh spChx2122">™</span>:

It's obvious OpenOffice.org is in <span
style="text-decoration: line-through; "><span
class="T2">good</span></span> friendly hands at Oracle. And I'm sure
that means they'll now go about fixing bugs that tarnish the openness,
freedom and collaboration inherent in the brand, not to mention stuff
like supporting some long overdue interoperability (collaboration)
features. Like preserving the data in Microsoft Word fields in .doc
format and adding <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>Save as
.docx<span class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>.

It's lovely to see that the logos will be available as SVG files. Pity
that OpenOffice.org Draw doesn't have SVG as a native format <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> there is an export/import feature but
last time I checked <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> trying to work
on SVG documents from Peter Murray-Rust it didn't really work properly.

To celebrate the new look, I'm going to go and log the bug in the
graphics handling in OpenOffice.org that meant that when my 9 year old
drew a picture of a snowman in OpenOffice.org Writer for a brochure for
his new travel enterprise <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>Frosty
Holidays<span class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>, the line-art didn't
print<span class="footnote"
style="vertical-align: super;">[1](#ftn1 "1 Well, I did try to log the bug   but (a) it turns out while the bug gets me often enough it's hard to reproduce at will and (b) there are so many bugs it's hard to figure out if it's a duplicate.")</span>.
See, the default line width in an OOo picture is '0' and this causes
lines to show OK on screen but render inconsistently for the web, PDF
and print. I knew that all we had to do was to change the line width to
something like 1mm because I ran into the same problem just the other
day with the diagram we've been building in our work on metadata stores
for data.

I wonder what's going to happen to the colours in the OpenOffice.org
pallette <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> <span
style="color:#333366; "><span class="T3">Sun1</span></span>, <span
style="color:#666699; "><span class="T4">Sun 2</span></span>, <span
style="color:#9999cc; "><span class="T5">Sun 3</span></span> and <span
style="color:#ccccff; "><span class="T6">Sun 4 </span></span>which give
off a reassuring sense of solid persistence and longevity not to mention
reminding us that the network is the computer. Maybe it's not any more.
Are we supposed to say <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>The database
is the computer<span class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> now? Will there be
new Oracle colours too? Will the Sun colours be dropped or deprecated?

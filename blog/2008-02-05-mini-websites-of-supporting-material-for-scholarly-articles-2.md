There's a link there to an article about butterflies, with some extra
material in HTML.

<span style="country:US; language:en; "><span class="T2">This sounds
like something that </span></span>[<span
style="country:US; language:en; "><span
class="T2">ICE</span></span>](http://ice.usq.edu.au/)<span
style="country:US; language:en; "><span class="T2"> could do really
well. ICE has lets you create <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>mini-websites<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> complete with internal navigation with
an export to ZIP. The ZIP files exported by ICE are actually IMS
packages, designed to slot into learning management systems, but they
work as stand alone websites. You can see </span></span>[<span
style="country:US; language:en; "><span
class="T2">examples</span></span>](http://ocw.usq.edu.au/course/view.php?id=7)<span
style="country:US; language:en; "><span class="T2"> at the USQ open
courseware site, see the automatically generated navigation at the left?
This could be a good way to package materials. You can tie just about
anything together into a package using ICE, and we're working hard right
now to make sure that there are tools to help embed data visualizations
into documents as seamlessly as possible.</span></span>

<span style="country:US; language:en; "><span class="T2">I'm working on
a paper at the moment about exporting HTML from word processors. One of
the things I've been doing is </span></span>[<span
style="country:US; language:en; "><span class="T2">documenting some of
the issues with the built-in HTML
export</span></span>](http://del.icio.us/ptsefton/xhtmlchallenge)<span
style="country:US; language:en; "><span class="T2"> in widely available
software packages. I was just going to link to the blog, but one idea
would be to include all these blog posts and a set of sample documents
as a package to go along with the paper. Whether or not a publisher
would be set up to take it is another matter.</span></span>

<span style="country:US; language:en; "><span class="T2">Another
packaging mechanism that might be useful given tools to support it would
be METS packages. We saw first hand at our </span></span>[<span
style="country:US; language:en; "><span class="T2">repository interop
workshop</span></span>](http://ice.usq.edu.au/blog/?p=105)<span
style="country:US; language:en; "><span class="T2"> how APSR developed
an Australian METS profile for packaging journals, to enable automated
deposit from a journal management system into a repository. But who
knows how to make a METS package? Apart from geeks like the ICE team, or
some special repository-rats</span></span><span
style="country:US; language:en; "><span class="T2">[<span
style="vertical-align: super;"><span
class="footnote">1</span></span>](#ftn0)</span></span><span
style="country:US; language:en; "><span class="T2">, that is. BioMed
Central's choice of ZIP is sensible. No fancy metadata required, just
make sure your ZIP has an entry point named index.html. But it could do
more if it knew how to deal with IMS content packages or a METS profile
as well.</span></span>

> file using the regular manuscript submission system, which will
> recognize and process it automatically. Full guidelines are provided

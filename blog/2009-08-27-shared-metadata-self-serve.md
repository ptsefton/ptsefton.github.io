Bryan Lawrence has pointed out [The relationship between collecting
metadata, and the optimum size of a child's plate of
food](http://home.badc.rl.ac.uk/lawrence/blog/2009/08/26/plate_size).
Bryan says:

I think this is a great analogy and it's really important for us to
think about as we look at working towards with the Australian National
Data Service ([ANDS](http://ands.edu.au/)). How do we get the right
serving size for metadata? I would like to explore this a bit more.

They only saw a little bit of it, because we were, you know preparing
and eating our dinner together instead of watching it on TV, but like
the rest of Australia they're now competing to make alternative
dressings for the Sunday caesar salad. And they're using that hot phrase
<span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>[plating
up](http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,25833084-5012445,00.html)<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>. Thing is, at our place we've evolved a
*shared-food* approach, which from something I read in an airline
magazine, I gather is even hotter than plating up; everyone picks what
they want from a shared selection. We did this to avoid conflict around
food and engender sensible eating habits.

It works <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> even though there is no
parent stacking food on plates the offspring tend to consume a
reasonable amount and balance of food.

How?

It involves an ongoing conversation and negotiation about balance and
which foods you should eat more or less of, and so on. Our experience is
that the freedom to choose, plus the dialogue, eventually results in
something pretty close to what we would have chosen but with reduced
conflict and, we hope, higher probability that habits will persist
because they are motivated by something other than parental authority.

What I'm saying here is yes <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> Bryan
is right about getting the portions in proportion and asking for the
right amount of metadata, but beyond that we also need to have the kinds
of conversation with the researchers that we have with our kids about
why they need to eat the right amount of the right stuff / supply the
right amount of good quality metadata.

I'm curious about how we might work with our data providers to let them
pick from a selection of metadata they can choose to provide. Could we
evolve a system which asked for, say, just a title, without all those
blank metadata fields staring at them like a plate full of snack
cabbages<span class="footnote"
style="vertical-align: super;">[\*\*](#ftn2 "** Brussels sprouts – Thanks Maestro Mal Webb  for that meme.")</span>.
(Could we bribe them? <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>If you add a
couple of subject codes you can have some strawberries.<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> Could we appeal to their vanity? <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>Filling out the *rights* field will make
your hair go curly.<span class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>)

We will try some of these ideas with our work on [The
Fascinator](../http%3B//fascinator.usq.edu.au); the idea is that if
users enter some metadata they'll get something they want, like a
backup, or their document will move through some kind of workflow that
they actually care about, but along the way we'll be also working a lot
on instilling healthy metadata management habits in our researcher
communities that go beyond immediate gratification, because as Bryan
notes, ultimately it will be peers who drive this and the whole point of
collecting the metadata is to assist the research process.

[Update: added link to the paper] [The short paper Duncan Dickinson and
I put together for this
conference](http://ptsefton.com/2010/04/25/repositories-post-2010-embracing-heterogeneity-in-awe-the-academic-working-environment.htm)
is organised around the conference themes, and what our Research and
Development group at the Australian Digital Futures Institute is doing
about each of them. In this presentation I will pick out some of the the
work we're doing and some of the issues we're thinking about, and try to
relate this work back to the conference themes. It's gratifying to be
able to make this presentation. Some of the core ideas we're talking
about here were the subject of a proposal I submitted for Open
Repositories 2007, but it received mixed reviewer feedback and was
relegated to a poster; my message that repositories were stuck in <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>Web 0.5<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> and needed to be made more webish was
not timely.<span class="Footnote_20_anchor"><span class="footnote"
style="vertical-align: super;">[<span>1</span>](#ftn1 "1 At dinner on Monday night I was told that the ideas we're pushing here at ADFI are “15 years ahead” of where the users are. Given that this paper was accepted, and doing some quick maths in my head I think that means that we have only 25 months before the things that we're talking about here are considered relevant, given that we're working in Internet time.")</span></span>

# Conference themes

Please tick these off as I go.
1.  **The web and the repository & The cloud and the desktop**\*
2.  Knowledge and technology
3.  Wild and curated content
4.  Linked and isolated data & Ad-hoc and long-term access
5.  Disciplinary and institutional systems / Scholars and service
    providers
6.  Ubiquitous and personalized environments

\* This is the big one!

</div>

So, what is this AWE thing?

# The Web and the Repositories

We're **on** the web, but are we **of** the web?

</div>

<div class="slide">

# Show and tell

-   Repositories need to understand **renditions** and **rendering**
    -   Rendering: The [<span class="Internet_20_link">ICE
        service</span>](../../api/convert) <span
        class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> renders web versions of
        everything it can and extracts metadata.
    -   Renditions: See our site for[<span class="Internet_20_link"> USQ
        policies</span>](http://demo.adfi.usq.edu.au/library/default/search).
        HTML all the way.
-   We're working on small pieces of web-infrastructure that should
    apply across multiple repositories.
    -   Anotar: annotations toolkit designed to be easy to plug in to
        any web system <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> even I can
        do it. See this [<span class="Internet_20_link">WordPress
        version</span>](http://demo.adfi.usq.edu.au/blog/2010/05/25/anotar-wordpress-plugin/).
        (Not as good as [<span
        class="Internet_20_link">digress.it</span>](http://digress.it/)
        but much more portable).
    -   [<span
        class="Internet_20_link">Paquete</span>](http://demo.adfi.usq.edu.au/paquete/demo/#module01.htm):
        An ePUBesque reader you can embed in any web page. Also a way
        for us to support compound objects in a repository.
-   We're working on bringing the web to the desktop. \<Insert demo of
    The Fascinator Desktop\>

# Issue: What will happen when vertically controlled computing platforms are the norm?

Does the desktop/lab/home PC become a server? Or will it live in the
cloud?

</div>

I brought an iPad with me on this trip, but I have found that I can't
put music on it or look at the books I have bought across **four** <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> yes, four <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> different reader applications using
standard file-operations. Imagine the problems if we have to deal with
valuable research data which lives on these controlled devices. A whole
new era of format lock-in that makes Microsoft look like a free-software
hippy. This is one reason why the web, and delivering stuff in web
formats is important.
<div class="slide">

# Idea: How about ePUB as a repository packaging format?

(In my reading of the specs) ePUB is engineered for overloading:

A zip file containing:
-   (At least) XHTML, with optional extra elements & a flat table of
    contents.
    -   Can include video, chemistry, whatever if you provide fallback
        image/text.
-   Allows for alternate renditions such as PDF, docx or odt originals.
-   We could include an HTML 5 version (using something like Paquete)
    for modern browsers/devices.
    -   Javascript is allowed <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> but
        must be ignored by ePUB readers but could be used by web apps.

</div>

<div class="slide">

# Idea: [<span class="Internet_20_link">ePUB</span>](http://www.openebook.org/) use-cases

**Repository:**<span style="font-weight: normal;"><span class="T2">
(SIP/AIP/DIP?)</span></span>
-   Serve the content using an in-page eReader (Paquete).
-   Let the package handle package semantics (pre-print, published
    version, presentation), repository can continue to handle streams.
-   Support viewers for data types for defined periods, such as JMOL for
    chemistry <span style="font-weight: normal;"><span class="T2">using
    something like ePUB's fall-back mechanism and oEmbed.</span></span>

Users:

-   If all else fails: unzip the package and click 'index.html'
-   Use with eBook reader software/hardware.

Developer / repository manager:

-   Add more packaging info <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> ORE,
    METS etc.

</div>

One of the other things were look at at ADFI is ways of bootstrapping
the Linked-Data/Semantic Web. I (Peter) have proposed a way of embedding
RDF statements in documents using simple interoperable URIs. Duncan has
taken this work further with a system that can serve 'proper' RDF. The
demo here shows this technique for metadata, but it could also be
applied for other kinds of semantics, when you are talking about
someone, for example rather than asserting that they are an author or an
editor.
<div class="slide">

# Idea: Making linked data, well, links

-   Step 1: Approach your repository or ID provider, search for self
    [<span class="Internet_20_link"><span
    style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; text-transform: none;"><span
    class="T6">http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-541658</span></span></span>](http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-541658)<span
    style="color: #333333; font-size: 10.5pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; text-transform: none;"><span
    class="T4"> </span></span> Note: wrapping this link around some text
    is essentially meaningless. It's not the semantic web it's the
    old-web.
-   Step 2: Copy the link labelled <span
    class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>Assert Authorship<span
    class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>
    `http://ontologize.me/meta/?r=http://purl.org/dc/terms/creator&o=http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-541658`` `

</div>

<div class="slide">

# Word processor-proof linked data <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> part 2

-   Step 3: Paste onto document text Author: [<span
    class="Internet_20_link">Peter
    Sefton</span>](http://ontologize.me/meta/?r=http://purl.org/dc/terms/creator&o=http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-541658 "This is the author, ID: [http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-541658]")
-   Step 4: Deposit somewhere that understands
    <a name="graphics6"><span>
    </span></a>![graphics6](/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/11a98ed3.png)
    `<oai_dc:dc>`
    `<dc:title>AWE - Presentation for Open Repositories 2010</dc:title>`
    `...` `<dc:creator>http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-541658</dc:creator>`
    `</oai_dc:dc>`

</div>

<div class="slide">

# Conclusion

We (like many others) are building a toolkit for web/repository
construction. The key reasons we rolled our own are:
-   We care about having web-resources not just PDF.
-   We wanted to be able to deploy the application to the desktop (hence
    a Java app that can be deployed with Apache Solr).

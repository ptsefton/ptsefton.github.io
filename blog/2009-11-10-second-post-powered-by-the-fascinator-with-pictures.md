A few days ago I did [my first blog
post](ptsefton.com/2009/11/06/first-post.htm) from [The Fascinator
Desktop](fascinator.usq.edu.au/desktop/desktop.htm). This post is just
to show that embedded images are now supported. Next step will be
posting a presentation to a blog. After that we'll be looking at
repository deposit, and the ability to build complex objects from
multiple parts and post/deposit *those*.

Here's a screenshot of the very slick (yet monochrome) interface that
Oliver Lucido has put together:

I [wrote last
week](http://ptsefton.com/2008/02/22/opendocument-format-support-not-as-great-as-the-cheer-squad-keep-saying.htm)
about the way supporters of the OpenDocument Format talk-up the number
of supporting applications, but for our purposes the support is not as
widespread as is often claimed.

Now there's a post on the Official Google Blog [A renewed wish for open
document
standards.](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/02/renewed-wish-for-open-document.html)Note
the plural; standards.

They talk about supporting the Open document Format, even though support
in their Google Docs product is pretty limited. I think this is support
in the political sense, not in the sense that matters to users. Here's
the usual pointers to Wikipedia lists of supporting applications, most
of which I reckon would disappoint if you tried them:

> Google supports open document standards and the [Open Document
> Format - ODF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument), the
> recognized international standard ([ISO
> 26300](http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=43485)).
> ODF is [supported](http://www.odfalliance.org/memberlist.php) and
> [implemented](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_applications_supporting_OpenDocument)
> across the globe, and its communal [creation and
> iteration](http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=office)
> has helped ensure the transparency, consistency and interoperability
> necessary in a workable standard.

But despite the plural in *standard*s, they are not wanting to support
the Microsoft-led OOXML standard on its journey through ISO. Maybe these
reasons are valid, I don't have time to investigate:

> Google's concerns about OOXML include, but are not limited to:
>
> -   The limitations on the openness of OOXML format;
>
> -   The lack of proper review as compared to other ISO standards;
>
> -   The continued use of binary code tied to platform-specific
>     features; and
>
> -   Unclear licensing terms for third-party implementers.

Me, I don't particularly care about the bickering; as a practitioner
working with document formats I know that the OpenOffice.org Writer +
ODT combinations which AFAIK is the most mature implementation, does not
support lots of Word features, whereas OOXML supports all of them. And
Word doesn't support some ODF features. We do the best we can given
these realities. and Google Docs to edit ODT? Forget it.

As far as I can tell, the ODF format is pretty much built around the
OpenOffice.org application. See t[he comment from Gary
Edwards](http://ptsefton.com/2008/02/22/opendocument-format-support-not-as-great-as-the-cheer-squad-keep-saying.htm#comment-64)
on my previous post:

I don't really care if it's an ISO Standard but it will be important for
our work on document interoperability to have the OOXML spec out there,
and to have MS Office saving into native XML file formats. For example
if Word import in Writer doesn't improve then we'll probably look for
funding to extend out [ICE system](http://ice.usq.edu.au/) to work with
MS Word. And yes, we are active in feeding back problems to the OOo team
and we make contributions to the open source community as well as
whingeing.

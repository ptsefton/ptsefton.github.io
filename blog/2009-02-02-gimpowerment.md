At my house there lives an eight year old, who is almost certainly my
son. I came home on Wednesday to find him trying to mutilate a Pokemon
picture he'd snaffled off the web using the drawing program in
OpenOffice.org. This was not going well: a (not great) vector drawing
tool meets a bitmap image. But it does show that the Ubuntu application
menu works <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> at least he found
something graphics oriented under Applications / Graphics.

He and his mother asked, do we have something like Paint?

I thought, [the Gimp's](http://www.gimp.org/) installed on Ubuntu by
default, but it's a bit scary, so I had a look for basic paint programs
for Linux, ending up in the Ubuntu forums as always. It's so easy to
install stuff on Ubuntu <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> I can
connect from another machine while he's playing with the web and install
stuff from the command line:

    sudo aptitude install tuxpaint gpaint

Tux paint? An interface that would make even an eight year old vomit,
and no apparent way to open a file. Look at that lazy penguin which
appears to be sipping a daiquiri it could get of its arse[<span
style="vertical-align: super;"><span
class="endnote">1</span></span>](#ftn0) and find me file or two.

<span
style="display: block"><a name="graphics1"></a>![graphics1](/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/m4d41f69b-331x248.jpg)</span>

GNU paint? We found the rubber (eraser) tool OK, but the lack of undo
undid that application for us.

I said, <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>I guess you could try the
Gimp<span class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>.

He did. And he had no trouble at all. He'd say <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>I want to just keep part of the
picture<span class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> and we said <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>you want a cropping tool<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>, and that was enough for him to poke
around and find what he needed. The only drama was to do with the
filesystem <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> he accidentally saved
one of his creations in the wrong place <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> but we found it.

I mention this because kids understand that to use a new application you
have to learn[<span style="vertical-align: super;"><span
class="endnote">2</span></span>](#ftn1) how it works and they don't have
the unreasonable expectation that it should be intuitive, whatever that
means.

I'm sure this is somehow relevant to eResearch and eLearning and the
work that we do on [tools](http://ice.usq.edu.au/) for same.

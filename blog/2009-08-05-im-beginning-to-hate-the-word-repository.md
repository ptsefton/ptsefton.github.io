I have been writing an article for the [Special Issue of the New Review
on Information
Networking](http://repositoryman.blogspot.com/2009/06/special-issue-of-new-review-on.html)
that Les Carr is putting together. He wondered if I would like to submit
something on repository architecture, and since I was about to blog
anyway about some of the [ideas from a previous post
here](http://ptsefton.com/2009/07/08/wanted-someone-to-actively-sell-open-repository-solutions-in-australia.htm#id3)and
keep a [promise I made on the CAIRSS
blog](http://caulcairss.wordpress.com/2009/07/21/nicnames-and-people-australia-some-thoughts-for-cairss/)
to outline an architecture by which a service like the NicNames identity
management system might sit alongside a repository software application,
I rolled those things into a (rushed) article, which will appear
somewhere in due course <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> if it's
rejected I can always blog it.

One of the things I looked at in the paper was this notion that a
repository should be viewed as a set of services rather than a
monolithic application. I have quoted Clifford Lynch here before, and I
quoted him in the paper:

> In my view, a university-based institutional repository is a set of
> services that a university offers to the members of its community for
> the management and dissemination of digital materials created by the
> institution and its community members. It is most essentially an
> organizational commitment to the stewardship of these digital
> materials, including long-term preservation where appropriate, as well
> as organization and access or distribution. While operational
> responsibility for these services may reasonably be situated in
> different organizational units at different universities, an effective
> institutional repository of necessity represents a collaboration among
> librarians, information technologists, archives and records mangers,
> faculty, and university administrators and policymakers. At any given
> point in time, an institutional repository will be supported by a set
> of information technologies, but a key part of the services that
> comprise an institutional repository is the management of
> technological changes, and the migration of digital content from one
> set of technologies to the next as part of the organizational
> commitment to providing repository services. An institutional
> repository is not simply a fixed set of software and hardware.

The cognoscenti do go on like this. I know I'm guilty. I have been heard
to argue that the repository should be thought of as an institution (or
a lifestyle, or a way of life, or a governance framework) rather than a
software application, but for most working repository managers I suspect
that the repository is really much more closely tied to and bounded by
the software application used than to some fancy 'set of services' or
governance framework. Try this. It seems natural enough to say <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>What repository do you run?<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> whereas you would never ask a librarian
<span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>What library do you run?<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>

Anyway, as I was thinking about an outline for the paper I did a quick
unscientific (and slightly inept) poll on Twitter.

> Hi repository people (& rat.) Can you define "repository" or
> "institutional repository" here in Twitter, in yr own words
> please?[3:48 PM Jul
> 21st](http://twitter.com/ptsefton/status/2769544876) from web

It was inept because I should have used a hashtag for people to label
their replies instead of them coming back to @ptsefton. I tried again a
bit later.

> [\#repodef](http://twitter.com/search?q=%23repodef) Can you define
> "repository" or "institutional repository" here in Twitter, in yr own
> words please? Will blog results.

The reason I asked was I was interested to see if people's definitions
were of repository as monolithic-application, or tended towards
service-orientation or repository-as-institution.

Presented below are all the responses directed at me. There may have
been others, that were just tagged, but as I write this Twitter is
returning zero results for a the tag \#repodef.

I will comment on a few of the responses. An early participant was Tim
McCallum from my team. He's the [CAIRSS](http://cairss.caul.edu.au/www/)
(Repository Support Service) Technical Officer and and he had a very
concrete view of the repository as 'a system' with an emphasis on
research output, as I'd expect from someone up to his neck in the
day-to-day issues with repositories and the [System to Evaluate the
Excellence Of Research (SEER)](http://www.arc.gov.au/era/SEER.htm) here
in Australia.

Ploy <a name=":80"></a>Tangtulyangkul, who works for us from wherever in
the world she happens to be and has stoked the boiler of a repository in
Western Australia had a rather succinct view, to do with research
output, attributed to an ex-USQ person, Neil Godfrey.

<a name="status_2796653017"></a>A couple of people mentioned the
repository as 'a place' and there was mention of 'system'. Dorothea
Salo, tweeting in her repo-rat super-hero costume had a definition I
thought captured the Lynch view (she also had a silly definition):

I think that along with the rat Andy Powell had had the definition which
was closest to repository-as-institution. In the broadest sense a system
might include people:

Nigel Ward said that a repository was software, which from anyone else
would kind of confirm my view that people think of repositories as a bit
of software, but you have to remember that Nigel is an e-Framework
participant, and they see everything as a set of services <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> that's Service Oriented Architecture,
only without the capitals; soa so I will count his response as being one
for
repostitory-as-computational-services.<a name="status_27697753091"></a>

I'll leave you with all the replies that Twitter is showing now,
starting with the most recent. Comments welcome. No, no statistics or
further analysis except some 'don't rely on Twitter to remember a
hash-tag from two weeks ago'.

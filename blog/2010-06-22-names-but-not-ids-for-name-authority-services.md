In my last post I asked <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>[What
should we call this name-authority, vocabulary-server, linked-data URI
factory service we are building for
ANDS?](http://ptsefton.com/2010/06/18/what-should-we-call-this-name-authority-vocabulary-server-linked-data-uri-factory-service-we-are-building-for-ands-2.htm)<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> I got a few answers, one of which I
really like, but they're really suitable as names for a particular
service rather than the **class** of services.

MINT
:   <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>Mashing Identifiers and Names
    Together<span class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> <span
    class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> Debbie Campbell of the NLA.

AWESOME
:   Dorothea Salo suggested this without a gloss. I'm not sure if she
    realised the tie-in with AWE <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span>
    [The Academic Work(ing)
    Environment](http://ptsefton.com/2010/04/25/repositories-post-2010-embracing-heterogeneity-in-awe-the-academic-working-environment.htm)
    which is a working title for the technology stack we use, and which
    is the theme of my talk for Open Repositories 2010. So with my, um,
    awesome, DIY backronym skillz it's:
:   <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>Academic Work Environment
    Semantics for Open Materials Exchange<span
    class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>

CATNIP
:   <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>Collating All Terms Name
    Identifier Project<span class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>. This is
    Andew Treloar's [update: fixed spelling] attempt. Not really in the
    same class as ARROW, DART and ARCHER.

But still, the **class** of thing I was describing doesn't seem to have
a name, and nobody at the round table had a suggestion. I am now
thinking that it should be called an **Linked Authority Control
Service**. That is, it's a thing to do [authority
control,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authority_control) in a
linked-data, semantic-web way. But what call the instance of the
service? Well, the naming convention we're developing for [The
Fascinator](http://fascinator.usq.edu.au/), the software
construction-set which will power the service is to have <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>editions<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>, so the thing you would download and
install would be called something like <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>The Fascinator, Linked Authority Control
Edition<span class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> which you might install
alongside <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>The (forthcoming)
Fascinator, Institutional Repository Edition<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> and set up to integrate with instances
of <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>The Fascinator, Desktop
Edition<span class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> sprinkled around the
institution, picking up data and related publications at the source,
from people's local drives, labs, instruments etc. Once you've installed
it and you need a name to call it by, I don't think you can go past
<span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>**The Mint**<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>, so thanks Debbie, I'll get you
something minty next time I see you. Just think what we can do with our
own linked-data mint. We can control the linked-data economy. If we
wanted to cause inflation by minting new URI's for John Smiths without
having enough actual John Smiths to back them up then we, like, could.
Not that we'd use our power for evil or nothing. Come to think of it, if
I could mint another *Alan* *James* Smith I would.

Title: Reading in the new Word? Really?

While I don’t spend nearly as much time as I used to working on web
publishing systems I am still thinking about how academic users can make
the most of tools like Microsoft Word and keeping an eye on things.
Today, there was an exciting and enticing post from the Word team.
[Reading in the new
Word](http://blogs.office.com/b/microsoft-word/archive/2012/08/07/reading-in-the-new-word.aspx).

At last, I thought, they’re going to add proper HTML support! And maybe
even ePub!

But no, there’s no mention of HTML at all, it’s about the a reading new
mode for Microsoft Office itself, brought to you by “the members of the
reading, object zoom, resume reading and navigation pane feature crews,
most of whom are shown here”. Based on the picture, that’s more than a
dozen people rearranging the deck chairs while the recent versions of
Word I have for Mac and Windows still can’t save sensible clean HTML5 to
files and web APIs except under very specific conditions involving the
marginalised blogging feature.

The reading platform for the world is the web. You have that in Redmond?

Word’s still a really good writing environment if you use the right
selection of features, and even if it weren’t it’s still something that
we’ll have to support and live with in academia for a long time to come.
For example, I’m working with climate change researchers who use R
scripts to massage their data, run their models and generate figures for
articles, but despite all the reproducible goodness of the process, the
‘papers’ still get written up in Word.

By the way, I’m still slowly working away at the [WordDown HTML
conversion](http://ptsefton.com/2011/10/18/worddown-word-to-html5-conversion-tool.htm)
tool I started last year on the JISC HTML5 project, kind of like
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for word
processing. It does a good job of exporting Word documents to HTML,
based on simple formatting like headings, indenting, list formatting and
so on. Maybe the Word HTML feature crew would like to take a look at
that, I’d even re-license the code so it was safe for them to look at if
that’s a problem.

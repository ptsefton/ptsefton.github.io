# Culture and climate

I was invited to attend the planning day for the Institute for Culture
and Society ([ICS](http://www.uws.edu.au/ics)) at the University of
Western Sydney, to talk about the [eResearch
team](http://eresearch.uws.edu.au) at UWS, discuss collaboration tools,
and show a few useful, relevant examples of eResearch in the humanities.

Here are some rough notes for the discussion.

For eResearch I will talk about our small eResearch website, and on the
subject of collaboration tools I’ll be evasive.

<section>
## The problem with surveys of collaboration tools

While lots of people are interested in finding out how to collaborate
using modern techniques we really need to talk this through on a project
by project basis.  I tried to write about collaboration tools at the
Australian Digital Futures Institute after complaints from an education
researcher in the institute about the bewildering array of *stuff* we
used to get things done. I gather it was like turning up for work as a
carpenter’s apprentice and being introduced to *all* the tools in the
ute at once.

(That piece is still online, but it is of historical interest only, as
the tools have all changed. Not to mention it is very long winded and
mentions some USQ tools that aren’t relevant to you, still if you’d like
to see [how I explained Twitter and hashtags, and predicted the demise
of Google Docs ‘cos Google Wave had
arrived](http://ptsefton.com/2009/07/08/adfi-collaboration-and-documentation-tools.htm)
then you might enjoy it. Otherwise, file as too long, don’t read.)

## Dr Sefton’s quick cure for a lack of online collaboration

If in doubt, start a Google Group. If symptoms persist, see me in the
morning; I may put you into one of my group therapy sessions.

</section>
Ok, so maybe that advice about collaboration tools is a bit too short.
But rather than list tools, I’ll put up this list of collaborative tasks
(not tools) as potential discussion topics to come back to, either in
this session or in a future dedicated workshop or consultation.

<section itemscope itemtype="http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide">
## Some collaboration modes/tasks

-   **Talking to each other:** email, video/audio conferencing,
    discussions

-   **Writing together:** word processing, wikis, Content Management
    Systems

-   **Publishing:** blogs, wikis, Content Management Systems,
    pod/video-casting, CVs, microblogging

-   **Remembering and sharing:** links, reference materials,
    bibliographic references

-   **Storing:** stuff

**Which tools do you favour and why?**

## eResearch for Culture and Society

Back to the more interesting topic – eResearch as it relates to culture
and society.

On the way to work on Monday I rode through local instances of some
lovely spring weather (cold enough for me to want a jacket descending
the mountains, warm by the time I got to the river), which got me
thinking about the climate and in turn the Hawkesbury Institute for the
Environment ([HIE](http://www.uws.edu.au/hie)), which is just downstream
from Penrith.

The eResearch team does a lot of work with HIE and the connection is
easy to see. We obviously need large amounts of data to document, let
alone model, climate, and we need to run climate simulations at
atmospheric and oceanic scale as well as at smaller scale, like models
of leaves or trees – all of which involves data management,
computational tools and global collaboration.

<section itemscope itemtype="http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide">
## Weather, climate, and the ICS planning day reminded me of an [analogy of Michael Halliday’s](http://books.google.com.au/books?hl=en&lr=&id=R26GCAZHw5MC&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&ots=Nz766k4s4q&sig=WaHhKvSWan_xYqrA3RJuQLq4QYU#v=onepage&q&f=false):

> We can perhaps use an analogy from the physical world:
> the difference between “culture” and “situation”
> is rather like that between the “climate” and the “weather”. 

</section>
I used to think about this analogy a lot, particularly when some
lecturer was getting us undergrads to formulate grammar rules from half
an A4 page of dodgy examples. Those ‘models’ (including Halliday’s) were
severely limited by the number of data points that supported them.

Then I was introduced to corpus linguistics in the early 1990s in a
workshop by [John
Sinclair](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McHardy_Sinclair "John McHardy Sinclair").
In the workshop multiple instances of words in context were used as data
to help decide what they actually *mean*.  The Collins COBUILD
dictionaries that Sinclair was involved in producing gave quite a
different picture of the ‘climate’ of English that the traditional
dictionary approach of forward-copying definitions by using, you know,
evidence to decide what words mean.

Fast forward to 2012 and the Macquarie dictionary decided to re-look at
its definition of misogyny, after the word got a bit of an airing in the
Australian Parliament, as noted in [this
letter](http://www.macquariedictionary.com.au/pdf/letter_from_ed.pdf)
from the Macquarie’s editor. I knew that they would have been able to
get plenty of data on the term’s use, and I thought of John Sinclair
again. But the letter didn’t talk about data, curiously, it talked about
house-work.

> As Editor of the Macquarie Dictionary, I picture myself as the woman
> with the broom and mop and bucket cleaning the language off the floor
> after the party is over.

The dictionary is one sort of ‘cultural climate’ record, so of course we
have to have sceptics, like [this
example](http://www.heraldsun.com.au/opinion/macquarie-dictionary-widens-definition-of-misogyny-after-julia-gillards-putdown-of-tony-abbott/story-fncw91kq-1226498914785)
form the Herald Sun’s Patrick Carlyon, who like a good climate change
sceptic brings his own data to the table.

> announced a raft of further definition shadings to reflect recent
> political events and current affairs:
>
> Dog: To be known also as "cat", after a two-year-old boy at an East
> Brighton childcare centre pointed at a chihuahua and meowed.

These days, dictionary editors don’t need no fancy ‘corpus’ like they
used on those revolutionary Collins Dictionaries, as we find out from
[another
letter](http://www.macquariedictionary.com.au/pdf/editors_response.pdf)
they have the Internets, and not only that, they can still copy from
others, just like they used to.

I’m telling you this because I wanted to show a simple eResearch example
from the cultural sphere. Halliday’s climate analogy seemed apt. Just as
we know climate science is done with lots of data points, recording the
weather at the highest possible scale that add up to a climate record,
we can study cultural phenomena such as language by looking at
data-points of various kinds. Text is an easy example, because it’s easy
to search and there’s now a lot of it to search.

Anyway, with all that in mind, I wanted to ask the researchers from the
institute:

<section itemscope itemtype="http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide">
## What infrastructure do you need to do ‘culture science’?

Or is that a stupid/naïve/offensive question?

</section>

While people think about that I thought I’d continue with a few
examples, and come back to the discussion of collaboration and eResearch
tools at the end.

The Feds don’t seem to think this idea of ‘culture science’ it is
entirely stupid, as they have funded a couple of million-dollar plus
projects to build virtual laboratories, not just in sciences but in the
humanities.

<section itemscope itemtype="http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide">

A question for ICS researchers – what kind of cultural data is important
to you?

</section>
And again in round 2, there is a UWS-led bid to build a virtual
laboratory which is partly in the cultural domain; contract negotiations
proceeding on that one. This lab is very much like ‘climate science’ for
linguistics, musicology et al, bringing together data sets and letting
researchers run tools on them, generate new analyses and annotations and
feed back, to be built by the UWS MARCS institute.

One of the data sources that HuNI is linking into their Virtual Lab is
the National Library’s Trove. To demonstrate this I’ll want to try out
Tim Sherratt’s QueryPic tool, searching across the Trove Newspaper
database for occurrances of terms to do with the workshop topic, which
broadly speaking means stuff about Asian studies, and the Asian century.
Tim’s tool is an example of an eResearch tool that’s completely data
driven.

You can click on a data point to see a list of articles.

![](/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/wpid-Culture_climate.docx.htm_Culture_climate.docx_filesimage004.jpg)

But be careful with these results!

Q. Why were the Aussie papers talking about Asia so much in 1820?

<section>
#### A. They were talking about  <span class="apple-converted-space"><u>a ship.</u></span>

If only the Macquarie had something like this.

(There are some issues with this tool, not least of which is that this
is not a stable, fixed data set, people are actively improving it via
crowdsourced editing, and the data set is expanding so it would be
impossible to reproduce results. I’ve suggested that a solution would be
to place snapshots of the data into the Research Data Storage
Infrastructure starting to roll out now via lead agency, The University
of Queensland so that researchers could work on known-stable corpora,
and perform tricks like reindexing to improve performance on this class
of query.)

Contrast this approach of re-using existing data in a fairly generic
database to ask new questions with a very different kind of eResearch
application, the Dictionary of Sydney, a project of the Arts Computing
Lab at the University of Sydney; we can search for the [Art Gallery of
NSW](http://dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/art_gallery_of_new_south_wales)
where we’ll be meeting, and from there browse a rich curated web of
relationships between entries about buildings, people, institutions etc.

So, back to the question.

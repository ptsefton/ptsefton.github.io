This week I'm in Brisbane for an [ARROW](http://arrow.edu.au/) week. On
Tuesday there was the ARROW repositories day, which was live-blogged
[[1](http://digitalcuration.blogspot.com/2008/10/arrow-repositories-day-1.html),
[2](http://digitalcuration.blogspot.com/2008/10/arrow-repositories-day-2.html),
[3](http://digitalcuration.blogspot.com/2008/10/arrow-repositories-day-3.html)]
by Chris Rusbridge. Chris and I met via the blogosphere talking about
how many clicks it should take to put stuff in a repository. His
presentation at the ARROW day was good vision of how the repository
might disappear into the walls like plumbing. (It also turns out that we
nearly ended up working for the same institution at one stage.)

I [talked about OAI-ORE but spent a bit of time on the impact that other
standards](http://ptsefton.com/2008/10/14/what-the-oai-ore-protocol-can-do-for-you.htm)
have had on the repository world so far. Maybe too much, as David
Flanders [tagged the post](http://delicious.com/tag/crig) as <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>This post identifies some issues with
XACML in the ARROW project (it also talk about ORE a little)<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>.

One mildly surprising thing I got from the first couple of ARROW days is
that a number of people seem to think that repository is a dirty word
now and they try to avoid using it <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span>
maybe we should use the French-language version [*d<span
class="spCh spChxe9">é</span>p<span
class="spCh spChxf4">ô</span>t*](http://vital-test.sipr.ucl.ac.be:8080/vital/access/manager/Index)<span
style="font-style:normal; "><span class="T3">, which brings to my mind
the place where omnibuses go to sleep every night. (Renaud Michotte
showed us the work they've been doing at the Universit<span
class="spCh spChxe9">é</span> catholique de Louvain.)</span></span>

Wednesday was the ARROW community day <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> which was a slightly uneasy mix of
celebration and trepidation as ARROW central prepare to move on to new
challenges while the ARROW repository rats (depot dingos?) wonder about
how they'll go in a world where there's less support. In a
[HHGTTG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitchhikers_Guide_to_the_Galaxy)esque
gesture ARROW-central gave us all a towel. In addition to the towels,
which should come in handy, there is going to be a new repository
support service in Australia along the lines of the [Repositories
Support Service](http://www.rsp.ac.uk/) in the UK but we don't know what
that will look like yet.

I showed off [The
Fascinator](http://ice.usq.edu.au/projects/fascinator/trac/wiki/).

Today and tomorrow (Thursday and Friday) I'm at the second VALET
code-fest/camp thing at QUT. The developers have just started work, so
nothing to report yet but I'll report here.

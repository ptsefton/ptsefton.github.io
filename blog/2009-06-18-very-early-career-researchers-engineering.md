In our mission to revolutionize scholarly communications we often talk
about getting the early career researchers, well, early and teaching
them new tricks. (Peter Murray-Rust adds that the late career
researchers die, too).

At my house we have an early career researcher, who has been writing a
sixth-grade report on a substantial kite project. The document has been
written using the [ICE](http://ice.usq.edu.au) [Update: fixed link]

of course, so it is ready to go straight onto her non-existent blog and
into the household ePrints repository, in both HTML and PDF format.

I was away when the document was finalized but it is reported that when
it was, she went looking for her little brother (Grade 4) for <span

he's not my peer I'll see what **he** thinks.<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>

I'm so proud.

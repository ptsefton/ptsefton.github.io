Title: The tyranny of the file?

<article itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ScholarlyArticle">
 A wonderful [ad recently aired on Australian
TV](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u5TlfOiFXo). The product is Ezyline
and the ad announces “ The End Of Pegs”. It has some great writing in it
“Hang your clothes quick and bring them in fast”, (which I think really
should be “Hang your clothes quickly and bring them in fastly”). And my
favourite phrase of the century so far “**Ezyline** **frees you from the
tyranny of pegs**”.

This reminds me of something Bruce D’Arcus said last year in a
discussion on the [rumoured end of
files](http://ptsefton.com/2011/07/15/the-end-of-files-might-be-inconvenient-for-scholarship.htm)
and what that might mean for scholars.

Turns out Steve jobs also wanted to free us from the Tyranny of the
file. [Ole Begemann recently dug this
up](http://oleb.net/blog/2012/06/steve-jobs-on-the-file-system/):

We know that Steve wanted to sell you his stuff, and had a vested
interest in keeping you all tied to the Apple platform, but in a
research context we need to maintain absolute control over **our**
stuff, even if that makes us sound crazy. If you’re going to let the
email app manage your mail then you need to know that you can export the
mail so you can archive it, switch email clients, or platforms. None of
these things was necessarily Steve’s goal. Likewise for photos that
might be managed in an application such as iPhoto.

Like Apple, offering you the app that frees you from files, Ezyline
promises to replace the old solution of pegs + clothesline with a new
integrated solution where the line manages the pegging for you. But what
if you want to use the peg for something else, like, putting on your
nose, or clipping some bits of paper together?

Figure 1 Does the new integrated service make it inconvenient to do the
things you used to be able to do? Have we swapped the tyranny of the peg
for the tyranny of the Ezyline?

Does the service actually reduce your freedom? Here’s the Apple OS X
mail File menu.

Figure 2 Free from the tyranny of files AND of being able to export my
data?

“Import mailboxes” is there, but where’s the export?

Answer, right click a mailbox, such as the Inbox and you *can* export,
and the result is a standard format .mbox file.

No, wait, it’s not a standard .mbox file its some kind of Apple
proprietary format which you can wrangle into the standard format if you
search the internets and muck around a bit (I think, I haven’t tried).
Oh, no, wait there is no such thing as a standard for mailbox files.

Stop! If this email we’re talking about is important research or
archival data (like, say for a future Prime Ministerial Archive like
[this one](http://library.uws.edu.au/whitlam/index.htm)) then you’d need
to get this sorted **right now**.

John Gruber [said
it](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/12/29/dropbox-icloud):

> Sometimes we want files.

Yes, sometimes we do, but this generalises beyond the particular case
“we want files” – to “we want machine-independent services that give us
control over our data”.  The services might be file-services or APIs
(ODBC, SRU) or query languages (SQL, SPARQL). They might be standards
for data interchange. Or web services, such as a web of interlinked
pages you can download, or feeds RSS/Atom/OAI-PMH.

Every research tool, database and device needs to be evaluated. If I
start using this am I going to be able to fulfil my obligations under
[The Code](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/guidelines/publications/r39)?

By the way, I’ve done my due diligence on my new Ezyline and I am happy
to report that you can dismantle it and use it as a set of (very
expensive) pegs:

Figure 3 Turns out that even with Ezyline  that feared tyrant, the peg,
can still re-emerge

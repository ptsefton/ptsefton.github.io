A week ago I was at the [National Library's Innovative Ideas Forum in
Canberra](http://www.nla.gov.au/initiatives/meetings/innovative-ideas-forum/2010/program.html)
<span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> that's
[\#iif2010](http://twitter.com/). I posted [something about Kent Fitch's
take on innovation in libraries over on the CAIRSS
blog](http://cairss.caul.edu.au/blog/2010/04/21/innovative-ideas-for-cairss/).

One of the other speakers was Mark Pesce, asking [What Ever Happened to
the Book](http://blog.futurestreetconsulting.com/?p=282). This looks at
how books are evolving, and how they aren't, as they go electronic. Tom
Worthington had a rather harsh summary: [Whatever happened to plain
English?](http://www.tomw.net.au/blog/2010/04/whatever-happened-to-plain-english.html)
Well, OK, so it is a bit long winded. I think the main thing it offered
was a reminder that we don't yet know what 'the book' will become and
whether we will call it 'the book'. That's an important reminder and it
was an interesting tour of some of the issues.

One of Mark's gripes was that a lot of electronic publishing is merely
<span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>Publishing in light<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> and publishers are not embracing the
possibilities of a new medium; they don't even put links in their
material in a lot of cases resisting the <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>centrifugal force<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> that pulls readers away. I tweeted:

> [<span class="T1">\#iif2010</span>](../search%3Fq=%2523iif2010) I
> think electronic books (portable, cheap) ARE compelling, sure
> hypertext is nice to

To expand on that <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> there are
substantial benefits to having books published in light; the main one is
that, well, they're light. If I can read a book on my Android phone I
will, publishing in light makes the book weightless, lit for reading at
night and always with me <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> even
without reading glasses, 'cos I can make the words big.

The other point I want to make is about the nature of the links that
Mark Pesce puts so much emphasis on. As I said, he talked about a
tendency for some commercial publishers to resist linking. Later on he
talks about the way links distract and how this means that fewer long
texts are being consumed. Coincidentally, the same morning there was a
post on the O'Reilly radar blog: [Ebook annotations, links and notes:
Must-haves or distractions? - O'Reilly Radar](http://oreil.ly/9u1pox)
(it's short so you can afford to go and read it). This looked at the
same issue <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> the author's conclusion
is that our reading tools should allow us to turn links, annotations,
footnotes, marginalia etc on and off so we can be distracted, and drift
with the links or not as we choose. I agree <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> sounds like it must become part of our
reading experience.

Now, to the main point of this post. The bit about turning on and off
links and annotations reminded me of the work we've been doing on our
web annotation toolkit at ADFI. And I got to thinking that it would be
good to go beyond the author/publisher stuffing a text with links and
let third parties to add their own distractions. There are lots of uses
cases here; allowing users to make their own notes, in-text discussions,
letting a lecturer annotate a text book with notes for their students, a
toolbox for the Joycean Scholars to fiddle yet more with Finnegans Wake.

So, as a kind of experiment in Hypertext and in the spirit of
WriteToReply.org who do this with all kinds of documents, I have
[reproduced Mark Persce's script on my Anotar
server](http://anotar.ptsefton.com/?p=15) for you all (and me, and him,
too if he wants) to interact with, using the first tentative release of
the WordPress version of Anotar.. To comment, hover over a paragraph and
click the [Comment] link.

I'm sure there are lots of suggestions you can make about the interface.
We have not yet got the ability to highlight terms and add your own
links. Other obvious things would be a floating button to show/hide all
annotations, and the option to have stuff appear in the margin rather
than in-line. It's open source. Send us a patch.

And let me know if there are any bugs via ptsefton, at you know, the URL
for google's mail system.

I'm planning to upgrade this site in the next couple of days, moving away from WordPress to a static site generated using <a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.6.0/">Pelican</a>.

If you have a feed reader set up then there is a chance that it will stop working. As far as I know the feeds are at:

1.  [http://ptsefton.com/feed](http://ptsefton.com/feed) -- An RSS feed, I'm going to redirect
this to the one below. Your feed reader will probably cope. Feedly at least
seems to be OK with redirects.
2.  [http://ptsefton.com/feed/atom](http://ptsefton.com/feed/atom) --
    This will be the only feed on the new site

If you care about keeping up with this thing (and I know some of you
still do) then you might like to check back at the
[site](http://ptsefton.com) and re-subscribe to the feed if it stops
working. I'm planning another post tomorrow, so if you don't see an
update, check back next week. Or let me know what weird
Wordpress feed URL you're using apart from the
above and I'll add a redirect.

# Why?


* All the cool kids are doing it, static sites that is, although not necessarily using
Pelican.
* We're changing the blog at work from WordPress to Pelican. We wanted:
    *  To use a Python-based system cos Python is a standard language for
  researchers
    *  To reduce our [attack surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_surface) by getting rid of the
  script-kiddy's favourite CMS.
    *  To get some experience using Markdown for writing, cos that's
    trending up in research-land, including looking at publications
    that pull in data in a reproducible kind of way

# On this day in 2007

Ok, so it was a different day in 2007, but here's what [I wrote last
time I made a big change here](http://ptsefton.com/blog/2007/11/23/09-29-56.009487/).

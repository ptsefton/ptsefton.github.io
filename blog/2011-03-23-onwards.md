<span class="T3">Yesterday was my last day at the University of Southern
Queensland.</span>

<span class="T3">I won't miss the reminders to change passwords every 90
days, or the travel forms where you have to sign each line, number each
receipt and staple them all to bits of paper. </span><span class="T4">I
am mildly disappoint</span><span class="T5">ed</span><span class="T4">
that I won't get to try out the new End Of Journey Cycling Facilities
</span><span class="T13">which have been sitting there for months
looking nearly </span><span class="T16">complete</span><span class="T4">
but as I always sa</span><span class="T7">id</span><span class="T4">,
arriving </span><span class="T16">to </span><span class="T4">work
</span><span class="T16">at USQ every day </span><span class="T4">was
only the </span><span class="T7">s</span><span class="T4">tart

class="T7">m</span><span class="T4">y </span><span
class="T7">j</span><span class="T4">ourney.</span>

<span class="T3">I will miss the teams I have been working with for the
last decade or so in Toowoomba <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span>
first with NextEd and then with USQ. Except that I won't miss them
really, because all our work is open </span><span
class="T4">a</span><span class="T3">nd we'll still be collaborating on
the same code-base and the same big themes </span><span
class="T6">around</span><span class="T3"> content-aware repositories
</span><span class="T4">and sharing the same world-wide office we did
last week, even if the view from my </span><span
class="T5">'</span><span class="T4">home office</span><span
class="T5">'</span><span class="T4"> will be of the chaos the new puppy
has wrought on our back garden rather than the calm of the manicured USQ
lawns and the </span>[<span class="T4">J</span><span class="T4">apanese
Garden</span><span
class="T5">s</span>](http://www.usq.edu.au/facilities/gardens)<span
class="T4">. </span>

<span class="T3">Today I will try to clear all the ukuleles, cameras,
</span><span class="T15">Lego, </span><span class="T5">bu</span><span
class="T3">lldogs clips, conference swag, religious relics, medicines,
tools, compact disks, </span><span class="T6">cables, </span><span
class="T3">cassette tapes, broken jewellery and pens and so on off what
is allegedly my desk, make an effort </span><span class="T7">to
</span><span class="T3">put in last year's tax return and get ready to
start work on the </span>[<span class="T3">JISCPub
project</span>](http://jiscpub.blogs.edina.ac.uk/2011/02/08/40/)<span
class="T3">. </span>

<span class="T4">Yesterday </span><span class="T17">I had lunch with the
</span><span class="T4">Software R&D team. </span><span
class="T17">I</span><span class="T4">t's gratifying to have </span><span
class="T10">someone</span><span class="T4"> tell you that this is the
best workplace they've ever had and I appreciate the bottle of 18yo
Glenlivet and the socks, </span><span class="T5">and the advice
that</span><span class="T4"> I should wear </span><span class="T5">said
</span><span class="T4">socks with my black work shoes. </span><span
class="T5">Thanks Bron, I had no idea. </span><span class="T6">I tried
to read out what you had all written on the card to my partner last
night, while I sampled the top couple of centimetres of the whisky but I
couldn't do it without sobbing (although that may have been the talking
card, not me). </span><span class="T10">P</span><span class="T6">eople
thanked me for supporting them and giving them opportunities, if I
managed to do that, then it was because of the environment created by
the likes of the late Alan Smith, and Jim Taylor, who gave us space
</span><span class="T8">and time </span><span class="T6">to work
</span><span class="T8">on important projects. </span><span
class="T13">I will continue to try to live up to Alan's coaching,
</span><span class="T15">enabling</span><span class="T13"> style of
management.</span>

<span class="T8">Some of those </span><span class="T14">open source
</span><span class="T8">projects have just matured to the point that
they are poised to have a major impact on USQ </span><span
class="T14">like the </span>[<span class="T14">ICE
projec</span>](http://ice.usq.edu.au/)<span class="T14">t I brought into
existence six years ago, with members of the software team in the old
Distance Education Centre</span><span class="T8">. The </span>[<span
class="T8">ReDBox research metadata
repository</span>](http://www.ands-partners.org/blog/category/redbox/)<span
class="T8"> ha</span><span class="T11">s</span><span class="T8"> a
chance for local adoption </span><span class="T11">as part of an effort
</span><span class="T18">to</span><span class="T11"> improve practice in
managing research data for code-compliance and reuse</span><span
class="T8">. The media repository which shares 90% of its DNA
</span><span class="T11">with ReDBox</span><span class="T8"> has been
approved for more pilots, managing and transcoding video and audio, and
could play a major role in supporting the changing face of course
materials at USQ </span><span class="T14">in a potential post-ICE USQ,
</span><span class="T15">not to mention its potential as the open source
repository-of</span><span class="T16">-</span><span class="T15">choice
to run alongside the Moodle Learning Management system, which lacks a
scalable back-end content store and transcoding facilities</span><span
class="T8">. And the </span>[<span class="T8">Creative Arts
repository</span>](http://www.information-online.com.au/sb_clients/iog/bin/iog_programme_2011_B19.cfm?vm_key=FDFCF289-1422-0982-EB6DFCDABB77CB85)<span
class="T8"> </span><span class="T9">which can manage complex
relationships between works and exhibitions </span><span class="T8">has
impressed its stakeholders </span><span class="T10">and the outside
world, </span><span class="T8">just as the policy library did. All those
are the result of lots of c</span><span class="T9">oordinated effort
towards a common </span><span class="T12">technology </span><span
class="T9">platform that gives USQ more reach than many other
organisations. </span><span class="T15">I'm proud of my part in
</span><span class="T16">resourcing</span><span class="T15"> and leading
all that, and proud of the team who did all the hard work. </span>

<span class="T18">Tomorrow, </span><span class="T3">I'm looking for, but
yet not desperate for, a </span><span class="T11">senior</span><span
class="T3"> job in the scholarly technologies arena, anywhere in the
world, preferably somewhere I can continue the push towards web-based
scholarship we've been </span><span class="T6">making </span><span
class="T3">at the Australian Digital Futures Institute. </span>

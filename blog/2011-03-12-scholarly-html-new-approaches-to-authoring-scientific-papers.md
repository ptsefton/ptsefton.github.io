I'm in Cambridge, in England. And I have given a talk as part of the
leadup to Peter Murray-Rust's Scholarly HTML hackfest.

Peter's brief to me was to talk about whatever I thought was
interesting. One of the things that I find very interesting is word
processing applications and their relationship, or lack or relationship
to the web. I try not to talk about this topic at parties, not that I
get invited to many, but at a session entitled <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>Scholarly HTML: new approaches to
authoring scientific papers<span class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> I
should be able to at least mention Microsoft Word. Right? But more
broadly, I'm interested in how we can drag scholarship into the
twenty-first century. How can we

In this talk I thought I would talk about the relationship between
scholarly communications, computer-based authoring tools and the web.

# PMR has done a great job of [explaining *why* HTML](http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2011/03/10/scholarly-html-%E2%80%93-what-we-are-hoping-for/)

# In 1995

Working on web publishing tools for a small tech-writing group I built
automated scripts for taking styled, structured Word documents and
turning them into web pages. I thought:

-   <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>This is cool<span
    class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>.

-   And <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>this is really useful<span
    class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>.

-   And <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>someone else with more
    entrepreneurial flair will capture a big market with this.

-   And the big one: <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>The next
    version of Word will get this right.<span
    class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>

# In 1997

Working on authoring tools for standards writers at Australia's national
standards body I thought:

-   <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>this is cool<span
    class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>.

-   And <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>this is really useful<span

# Still waiting for decent HTML...

-   In 2000 working on authoring tools for an .com servicing online
    universities.

-   In 2005, working on a successful single-source web/print publishing
    system for the University of Southern Queensland:
    [ICE](http://ice.usq.edu.au/).

-   In 2011 as part of the Beyond the PDF movement.

# Scholarly HTML

Putting / doing scholarship on the web:

-   Documents plus data, provenance etc.

-   Packaging / bundling for human an machine use (Epub, ZIP).

# Things I'd like to show you

-   A usable interface for making structured word processing docs that
    magically turn into Scholarly HTML. (See [this post in the Beyond
    the PDF
    demonstrator](http://dev-win.adfi.usq.edu.au/btpdf/default/detail/ae318657c83f9bba628642bb653ef90e/)
    it was automatically redendered from this [OpenOffice
    document](http://dev-win.adfi.usq.edu.au/btpdf/default/download/ae318657c83f9bba628642bb653ef90e/scholarly-html-talk.odt)).

-   How we can embed high quality linked-data metadata in docs. (You can
    have a 'badge' you can paste into all your papers that identifies
    you as an author <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> like this

    <span property="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/foaf:name"
    resource="http://trove.nla.gov.au/people/541658">[Peter
    Sefton](http://ontologize.me/?tl_p=http://purl.org/dc/terms/creator&triplink=http://purl.org/triplink/v/0.1&tl_o=http://trove.nla.gov.au/people/541658)</span>).\
    \

-   A tool for managing research objects of the future <span
    class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> that's papers (or theses or blog
    post) plus all the supporting stuff that goes with them <span
    class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> see for example [a chemistry
    thesis](http://dev-win.adfi.usq.edu.au/btpdf/default/workflow/d3f6216f78b9abe536e949b10f8ff434)
    with attached Chemical Markup language files.

-   How we will be able to embed research data visualisation in a
    sustainable, easy way. (We're working on embedding 3d molecule
    viewers, having a few problems on the server but it Works For Me on
    my laptop).

</div>

<div class="slide">

# Things I hope to show you next week

-   Dead-simple packaging of rich research objects into a zip file <span
    class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> ready for upload to a repository,
    journal deposit, etc. We have epub working, log in using OpenId and
    you can covert [that
    thesis](http://dev-win.adfi.usq.edu.au/btpdf/default/workflow/d3f6216f78b9abe536e949b10f8ff434)
    to ePub, but ePub is not really suitable for bundling the CML files
    <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> we have to work out how to
    handle that.

-   Modern, rational citations built around linked data principles
    rather than where the commas and full-stops are.

-   Chemistry in WordPress blogs, via Scholarly HTML.That is, linking a
    document to some chemistry in the demonstator authoring enviroment,
    having it pushed as declarative Scholarly HTML over the wire to a
    blog and then having the blog sniff out the chemistry and use a 3d
    viewer applet to show a molecule.

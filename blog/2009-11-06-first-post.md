[Update 2009-11-25: Fixed broken links]
This week we missed a huge opportunity to promote our eResearch software
[The Fascinator](http://fascinator.usq.edu.au/), what with the race that
stops a nation and all that other spring racing stuff. There were
fascinators everywhere, even Toowoomba. But us geeks don't seem to care
about horse races as much as we care about repositories so none of us
got around to exploiting the PR goldmine.

Oh well. The good part is that instead of getting tipsy and staggering
home from the office with his high heels in his hand and his shirt
untucked and his fascinator at an odd angle, Oliver Lucido spent the day
coding up an AtomPub publishing button for The Fascinator Desktop.

So here we have a document which I have written using OpenOffice.org
writer and saved on my desktop.

1.  The Fascinator discovered it and showed it to me in my web browser
    along with all my other stuff.

2.  I hit the publish button and gave it the details of my wordpress
    blog.

Why is this important? Well we're doing this not just with trivial
documents like this one, but stuff like research articles and the data
that support them, and we won't just be blogging <span
class="spCh spChx2013">â€“</span> we'll be backing up, sharing, and
sending material to repositories, that's after we have let researchers
tag, classify and organize their data.

At this stage the service is text-only, but as as soon as I can I'll
post a followup on the [work we've been doing with
presentations](http://ptsefton.com/2009/08/17/more-progress-on-exploded-powerpoints-in-a-desktop-repository.htm),
inspired by Les Carr. Coming soon: SWORD publishing. My aim is to
deposit a presentation of mine in the local Eprints via this process:

1.  Find the presnetation in a conference repository.

2.  Import it into Zotero so I can use it on my CV.

3.  Via our Zotero / The Fascinator integration, see it in my
    desktop-web.

4.  Hit the Deposit button to send to USQ's repository.

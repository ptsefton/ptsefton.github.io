In this presentation for<span id="wsite-title"></span><span></span></a>
Semantic Web Technologies for Libraries and Readers ([<span>STLR
2011</span>](http://stlr2011.weebly.com/)), which I can't attend in
person I want to talk about what happens before things hit the library.
I have pre-recorded a couple of demos and asked Jodi Schneider if she
would mind introducing the talk for me <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> I know she has been following this work
for a while <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> maybe she can read out
this brief blog post and pretend to be me?

When I submitted this paper I selected three categories for it.

-   Strategies for semantic publishing (technical, social, and economic)

-   Approaches for consuming semantic representations of digital
    documents and electronic media\
    and collaboration

-   Social semantic approaches for using, publishing, and filtering
    scholarly\
    objects and personal electronic media

But really it's mainly about the first one, about getting linked data
semantics into digital libraries.

The proposal for this paper also had some stuff in it about 'big themes'
but given that I am not going to be there in person, and it is only a
short demo slot I will not attempt to address those themes.

# <span id="id2"></span><span></span></a>The ongoing issue with publishing to the web

Ever since the web began to hit the mainstream, there has been a big gap
between what's on the web as HTML and the kinds of documents that people
write in academia <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> papers, theses,
reports, and so on.

1.  For research publications PDF files rule. PDF is what is deposited
    in institutional repositories, and what people manage (or mismanage)
    in their personal digital libraries. PDF is not conducive to rich
    semantics (Yes, it can be done, the web is already ready for
    linked-data and *all* the action is on the web. And yes, some
    publishers are doing good things with the web, but they don't
    typically allow DIY authoring and repository deposit of rich
    semantic materials).

2.  Word processors and tools like LaTeX don't *Just Work* for making
    web documents it's more like *Just Doesn't Work*.

3.  When we start talking about semantics <span
    class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> and wanting to have stuff like RDFa
    in web pages <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> it is really hard
    to do with run-of-the mill scholarship, because our authoring tools
    don't support formal semantics. (Yes there are XML tool-chains such
    as TEI <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> but the heavy-duty XML
    approach has never been shown to work for large cohorts of
    non-technical users).

# <span id="id4"></span><span></span></a>Demos

I want to show a couple of demos

-   A method for encoding Linked Data statements in URLS, so they can be
    used in any system that support simple HTTP hyperlinks. URLs are
    supported everywhere and will survive being saved as .doc, copied
    and pasted, emailed and so on, if not a nuclear winter. See the
    [<span>screencast</span>](http://screencast.com/t/QdC9et9vUWG). This
    includes a lightning look at the [<span>The Integrated Content
    Environment</span>](http://code.google.com/p/integrated-content-environment/)<span
    class="T2">2</span> which tries to close the gap between document
    authoring tools like word processors and the web.

-   Packaging all of the above using EPUB, the open ebook standard using
    various tools and techniques from the [<span>Digital Monograph
    Technical Landscape
    study</span>](http://jiscpub.blogs.edina.ac.uk/)  using ORE<span
    class="T2">4</span> resource maps. See the[<span>
    screencast</span>](http://screencast.com/t/pQwHU1M8Mc9). One thing I
    didn't mention in the screencast is that this work builds on work
    done by the KnoweldgeBlog project in the UK who are on in the next
    slot in the workshop <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> we've
    never met. Hello!

-   I also wanted to look at new models for scholarly objects that allow
    documents, data and provenance to be managed, reposited and
    disseminated by demoing [<span>The Fascinator
    Desktop</span>](http://code.google.com/p/the-fascinator/).<span
    class="T2">3</span> but unfortunately that's not possible right now
    as the software in question is being moved to Google Code and the
    builds are broken <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> it should be
    fixed next week. I refer you to a long posting I put together for
    the [<span>Beyond the PDF workshop which has a lot of
    screenshots</span>](http://ptsefton.com/2010/12/09/beyond-the-pdf-proposed-session-bring-the-web-to-the-researcher-mainly-on-authoring-tools.htm).

    They key feature of this tool is that it can work with a wide
    variety of things and bundle them together into a single object,.
    The idea is to provide a web interface to your hard disk, or
    Dropbox-like share. In the post I look at a research object
    consisting of a paper, some data in a spreadsheet, some provenance
    information, and touch on how semantics about the scientific content
    of the paper could be marked up using the 'triplink' technique I
    demonstrated above. (I'll comment below when I am able to post a
    screencast).

Sorry I couldn't make it to Ottawa, hope you all enjoy the workshop.

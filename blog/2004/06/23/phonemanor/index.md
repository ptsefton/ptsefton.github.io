Russell Beattie, [whose stuff about clever telephones I read
compulsively](http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/), despite the fact
than my mobile is nearly as old as my school-age child, and I have never
learned to regret that it does not speak Java, is very proud of himself
for [purchasing the domain
mguru.com](http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1007888.html). Cool. I
have another suggestion.

It struck me tonight that somebody who cares about this stuff should be
talking from "phone manor" dot com in tribute to that ratbag Jerry
Pournelle , of Chaos Manor, whose charmingly architected [web
site](http://www.jerrypournelle.com/) claims to be the original blog,
and has some nice old fashioned text saying "Refresh/Reload Early and
Often!" instead of those stupid little orange XML things, or one of
those gauche Atom feeds like we have here. And he has a retro-chic look
that makes my Nokia 51-something look modern, even with the red snap-on
cover. PhoneManor.com is available; let me know if you buy it.

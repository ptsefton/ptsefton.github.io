The papers for Ausweb04 are [up
now](http://ausweb.scu.edu.au/aw04/conf/program_mon.html). Mine, for the
poster session, [is
there](http://ausweb.scu.edu.au/aw04/papers/edited/sefton2/), along with
another from NextEd. Mine explores the publishing and management of
course materials across multiple modes of delivery. Of course we are all
really going for the *Exclusive and Private Polar Bear Viewing - Sea
World Theme Park*. I have realised my long-standing ambition of being
bitten by a snake, so now I can try to get myself mauled by a bear. I
think they have some baby ones.

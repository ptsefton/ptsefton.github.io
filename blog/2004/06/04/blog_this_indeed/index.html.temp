</p><blockquote>Geeks like me are fine with writing in Emacs, but lots of people seem to like writing in word processors, and as of this week, I think that any word processor without a "Blog This" button is just broken. </blockquote>
<p>
Geeks like who? <a class="external" href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/03/26/OpenOffice">Geeks like Tim Bray</a>. Other people prefer <a class="external" href="http://www.oreilly.com/news/zenclavier_1299.html">vi</a> over Emacs, and James Tauber thinks <a class="external" href="http://www.jtauber.com/blog/2004/04/05/eclipse_is_next_emacs">Eclipse will be the next contender</a>. I prefer to write prose in a word processor, but then I'm not a geek. 
</p>
<p>
Here are my thoughts on blogging from a word processor, and how this might work with Atom, which <a class="external" href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/06/02/AtomMeetingReport#p-22">does not look promising at this stage</a>.
</p>
<p>
I like Tim Bray's idea of the "blog this" button, but I think we can do even better than that. As of today <i>I</i> think any word processor without a
</p>
<ul><li>make me an XHTML version of this content,</li>
<li>check with me how much metadata I would like to add,</li>
<li>help me provide an abstract by pulling out the first paragraph or two,</li>
<li>stick it in the corporate content store,</li>
<li>keep the original so it can be re-edited,</li>
<li>check if I want all of it  or a short bloggish summary  to appear in a blog,</li>
<li>ask if I want a PDF rendition,</li>
<li>and work out what distribution it should have,</li></ul>
<p>
button is just broken. Two clicks to just blog an item as is, a few more to slot it into a knowledge base where it can find others like itself on the basis of more than just the posting date. If I'm writing minutes from a meeting I probably want to store the full minutes and blog a summary but also be able to search by document type or by meeting. A good general purpose content management system can run a blog, but a blogging system is a just a web logging system. I want both.
</p>
<p>
In <a class="external" href="http://www.openoffice.org/">the OpenOffice.org application suite</a>, about which geek Tim Bray is talking in his post, my button looks easy enough to add, given a place to store the content and run the blog and so on. OpenOffice already has a nice way of keeping all its bits and pieces including images in one place, a zip file. It also has a barely acceptable export to HTML, which can be <a class="external" href="http://tidy.sourceforge.net/">tidied to make it into XHTML</a>. I am looking to see if OpenOffice can be scripted to add PDF, and HTML stuff to this container so it can be thrown around as a single object.
</p>
<p>
In MS Word the problem is somewhat different. From Word 2000 onwards there is a 'Save as Web' feature that gives you all of your content in an accessible format, including an HTML-ish version that's relatively easy to transform into XML, from where you can transform it easily to XHTML based on your styles. You even get web-ready versions of all your images and other component objects. But Word lacks an omnibus format that bundles them all together (yes I know about the Microsoft download that is supposed to do this but it doesn't work for me), and a built in PDF renderer.  <a class="external" href="http://www.teratext.com.au/get/page/directory/browser">The Ace scripting language has round-trip-functions for Word HTML</a> that I helped design. See this <a class="external" href="http://www.planetmarkup.com/xmlarena/xap/Thursday/WordtoXML.pdf">presentation in PDF I gave with Timothy Arnold-Moore</a>.
</p>
<p>
The bad news is that at this stage there is no way to do build this button and use Atom to add it to a blog without multiple posts. Tim Bray <a class="external" href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/06/02/AtomMeetingReport#p-22">again</a>:
</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>A crucial decision point seems to be whether you try to package up multiple pieces in one message, or not.</blockquote>
<p>
If Atom doesn't let you package multiple pieces in one message then I won't use it for posting to a repository. I don't understand all the technical stuff involved here  I naively thought of using a zipped bundle for multi part entries   but I don't want to have to manage multiple calls to a repository to do what should be a single transaction, and then have to manage rollback if something goes wrong. Been there.

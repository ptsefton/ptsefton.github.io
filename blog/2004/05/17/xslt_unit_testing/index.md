Title: "validates the tests themselves then runs them. - Most impressively, HTML"
Slug: xslt_unit_testing
Date: 2004-05-17

---formatting test-first. I can imagine how well this could work;
commissioning formatting from designers for each part of your schema
\\\*before\\\* you start coding, creating tests, validating the tests
themselves to make sure that the target output is sensible and then
coding each part. Just like I can imagine legions of designers standing
by to save me from my predeliction from whatever you call these colours
we have here (currently \\\\\\\#FF6699; \\\\\\\#FFFF00; and others I
forget). Jacek has done some free software before, so I'll encourage him
to release what he can.

simple XML format for expressing tests in XML, with input, expected
output(s) and a few parameters. They are using it test transforms on
parts of their proprietary format into both XHTML and XSL Formatting
Objects. As I understand it you take the input, run it through the
stylesheet and see if the output is \*\*exactly\*\* what you wanted. - A
choice to validate the output against a DTD or not, depending on how
practical that might be. - Some kind of extension to JUnit that
automatically finds test files, validates the tests themselves then runs
them. - Most impressively, HTML and PDF outputs that show what each of
the tests will look like in XHTML and in print (via xsl:fo). Jacek
reports that they are now doing their formatting test-first. I can
imagine how well this could work; commissioning formatting from
designers for each part of your schema \*before\* you start coding,
creating tests, validating the tests themselves to make sure that the
target output is sensible and then coding each part. Just like I can
imagine legions of designers standing by to save me from my predeliction
from whatever you call these colours we have here (currently \\\#FF6699;
\\\#FFFF00; and others I forget). Jacek has done some free software
before, so I'll encourage him to release what he can.

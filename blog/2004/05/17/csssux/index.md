Title: "harmful, leering face of CSS is trying to arrange containers on a page."

<div class="layout-header">

... \\\\ \\\\
<div class="layout-content">

... \\\\ The next trick is to lay out the page by writing CSS to
position the divs. This is where I have a problem - there is too much
unnecessary abstraction here. Actually abstraction is too kind, this is
a case of disconnection. I have to go over \\\*here\\\*, to a separate
file to CSS and try to move them divs around. me: "Hey you - go left".
me: You there - yes you, the table of contents, can you just sort of
float there under that logo. No not UNDER the logo, beneath it, I mean
further down the page." me: "And you, the main content div - can you get
back up here where we can see you." header: "Hey - the footer is sitting
on me." I'd say its like herding cats, but I don't use that metaphor. It
makes sense that it's this way - it suits the web design crowd. They can
spend their time evangelising at each other and selling website
makeovers. Now there's an idea for reality TV. PS - there are no tables
here because [this man](http://james.tauber.name) is a genius, like
[that old Italian bloke](http://james.tauber.name/leonardo).

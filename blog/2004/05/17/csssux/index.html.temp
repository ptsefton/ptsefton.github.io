Nice. Mine would not have been as well informed or reasoned. What this
'objective look' doesn't do strongly enough, is to look at the problems
with CSS as a page layout system. (Of course here in Australia we have a
classless society, so we are not allowed to use CSS.) CSS has two faces.
The smiling, benign face of CSS is setting 'style' information the way
you would do it in a word processor. You can set the font sizes and
colours for your pages in one spot. No problem (well, there are a few,
but nothing to what's coming). The horrible, harmful, leering face of
CSS is trying to arrange containers on a page. First you wrap up the
parts of your page in \\ tags, and give the div elements id's or
classes. \\
</p><div class="layout-header">

... \\ \\
<div class="layout-content">

... \\ The next trick is to lay out the page by writing CSS to position
the divs. This is where I have a problem - there is too much unnecessary
abstraction here. Actually abstraction is too kind, this is a case of
disconnection. I have to go over \*here\*, to a separate file to CSS and
try to move them divs around. me: "Hey you - go left". me: You there -
yes you, the table of contents, can you just sort of float there under
that logo. No not UNDER the logo, beneath it, I mean further down the
page." me: "And you, the main content div - can you get back up here
where we can see you." header: "Hey - the footer is sitting on me." I'd
say its like herding cats, but I don't use that metaphor. It makes sense
that it's this way - it suits the web design crowd. They can spend their
time evangelising at each other and selling website makeovers. Now
there's an idea for reality TV. PS - there are no tables here because
[this man](http://james.tauber.name) is a genius, like [that old Italian
bloke](http://james.tauber.name/leonardo).

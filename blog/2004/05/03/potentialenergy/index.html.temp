From the customer's format (and using their technology) everything
was \*\*downhill\*\* - high quality printed books, CD ROMs, the web, as
it was from FrameMaker. From Word you can do reasonable quality print,
but not if you want more than a couple of hundred pages when it becomes
an uphill battle. From a set of non-templated word processing file, or
text files a web site can be \*\*uphill\*\*. So that's the metaphor -
pedal a little harder to climb the hill (or use the gearing provided by
XML) and then the coast down to the outputs. The question is how can you
goad your authoring team into climbing that hill? It's no use picking a
mountain that's too high or they'll go around, or worse, make you push
them. Does anyone know of any prior art on this metaphor? (I'd go on
about potential energy and such, but I need to check with my Dad first
to make sure I get it right. I don't want to discuss the laws of
thermodynamics or bicyclemechanics with irate geeks.)

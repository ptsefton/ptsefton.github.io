Title: "Subversion for content again"

Last week I [wrote about using the Subversion version control
system](http://ptsefton.com/blog/2004/12/17/subversion_for_content) for
web content management on sites like this. I speculated about whether
the [Leonardo system](http://james.tauber.name/leonardo) which powers
this site would be able to work in the way I would like to work. This is
a quick update.

James Tauber, father of Leonardo, replied on the Leonardo mailing list
that Leonardo 0.4 is designed to support the kinds of things I'm after.
The storage system is pluggable, so it could be replaced with a
Subversion driven one, rather than using directories on the file system
to handle each resource. Other things on my wish list are of interest to
James, and possibly others, so it looks like Leonardo will be a good bet
going forward.

One contribution I expect to make is XHTML converters for Word and
OpenOffice.org, based on the templates I am (slowly) making for the
[word processor interoperability project](wp_interop_project) and using
my technique for turning [Word's HTML output into
XML](http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/12/08/word-to-xml.html).

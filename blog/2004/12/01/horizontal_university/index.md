Deputy Vice-Chancellor Professor [Jim
Taylor](http://www.usq.edu.au/users/taylorj) of USQ has been out and
about, talking about the future of Universities. I quote from the USQ
news ([PDF only](http://www.usq.edu.au/resources/usm04279(24_11).pdf)
I'm afraid).

> UNIVERSITIES need to develop comprehensive, end-to-end communications
> systems and knowledge management systems, so that they might be better
> able to respond to the growing demand for lifelong learning, and to
> satisfy the increasingly diverse needs of students.

And:

> In his keynote speech The Horizontal University: e-Learning as a
> catalyst for Organisational Transformation, Professor Taylor argued
> that organisations that could provide customised, high-quality,
> value-added services that satisfied customer needs with speed and
> accuracy at the appropriate price point would be the only
> organisations to survive in the 21st Century.

Jim's talking about flattening-out hierarchies and introducing knowledge
management culture, which makes me glad I'm here.

But the big question is: Do I have a chance at the coveted chair of
folkdancing at the new horizontal USQ?

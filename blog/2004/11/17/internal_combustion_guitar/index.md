I have been chatting with a robot.

Why? To find out about whether bots might be useful in a learning
system, for support, mainly. More on that later. But using the Standard
AIML (Aritifical Intelligence Markup Language) set with this [python
script](http://pyaiml.sourceforge.net/). You can have the following
exchange.

Me: Define guitar

It: A guitar is a lovely sounding 6 or 12 stringed musical instrument
that is strummed and or plucked.

Me: What is an electric guitar?

It: I do not know what electric guitar is. What about internal
combustion guitar?

Indeed, what *about* internal combustion guitar? It's now or, according
to some pessimists, [never](http://www.kunstler.com/mags_diary12.html).

But wouldn't you love to strap on a V8
[Strat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratocaster)?

Cameron Loudon and I have been working on an article about content
management for learning management systems. Still needs lots of work,
but we now have a draft available [in PDF](2004/advanced_cm.pdf).
Comments welcome. You can find it, and forthcoming drafts on my new page
for [stuff I have written](biblio).

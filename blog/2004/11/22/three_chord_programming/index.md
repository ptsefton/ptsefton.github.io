I have performed on stage at the Sydney Opera House several times.

It was a long time ago, like, in the seventies, with various combined
school choirs, recorder ensembles and such. The best thing I was
involved in, I got to play the milk bottles (half a dozen one pint
bottles in one of those little wire baskets). I rattled them, as a key
part of the 'Sounds of Sydney' an epic piece that took you through a
whole day from birds calling and the milko clanking to what we ten year
olds imagined a night club might sound like, with the help of our
teacher, Miss Lilienthal.

Read on to see how this relates to programming.

In that ensemble there were also people playing modded xylophones. Miss
Lilienthal took out the F and the B leaving us with a [pentatonic
scale](http://www.teoria.com/reference/scales/12.htm): C D E G A C.

With the pentatonic xylophone you can bash away and play anything you
like and it will sound OK; it's also pretty easy for a group of
ten-year-olds to work out a few different parts that work together.

I think this is what [Adam Bosworth is talking
about](http://www.adambosworth.net/archives/000031.html) here:

PHP is apparently the Xylophone with some of the bits missing so you can
bash away and make a tune. I'm no computer scientist, not that you would
call me a human, but PHP's origins in web pages with code embedded have
always bothered me; I don't want to work like *that* on the web, but I
do want to get on with dynamically adapting to information passed in,
and so on. I specifically do not want to have to write half a page of
code to parse an XML document, make a few changes and spit it back out
like we apparently have to do in Java.

Last week my family and I visited Mr John Reeves and family and we had a
bash on an assortment of musical instruments and wool-spinning devices.
The best bit, apart form the gorgeous Fender resophonic bass was the
ukulele collection. John and son Rueben taught me 4 chords in as many
minutes and I was away. Four strings, cheap to buy a nice sounding
instrument, portable, fun, and easy to get going. Almost as easy as
playing the milk bottles if not quite as cool. Where can I get an XML
aware programming language like that?

The incredible Russell Beattie is <a class="external" href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008146.html">thinking</a> <i>hard</i> about mobile telephones and what they're going to mean.
</p>
<p>
<a external="" href="update:_russell_points_out_that_he_&lt;a_class=">wrote_about_mobiles_and_muds</a>_recently._i_must_have_seen_that_and_forgotten._see_the_<a_class>comments_at_his_site."&gt;Update: Russell points out that he <a class="external" href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008025.html">wrote about mobiles and MUDs</a> recently. I must have seen that and forgotten. See the <a class="external" href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008146.html#1011439">comments</a> at his site.
</a_class></p>
<p>
Me, I sympathize, although for now I'm happy with the Nokia 5210 (or is it a 5120?) my girlfriend discarded. But the young people really like these mobiles. The aforementioned girlfriend has a girlfriend who'd be not a day over 38 and she's <i>always</i> texting. Not to mention the thirteen yearold niece, who apparently prefers SMS, and MSN to voice, even to face to face.
</p>
<p>
Me, I've been playing with Linux. I can now SSH from anywhere (work, anyway) to the computer I bought from my previous employer for $25 and type at it in my rusty, faltering Unix. So much more satisfying than all that gauche windowesque gesticulating with the mouse. Linux and I know each other so well it can finish my sentences (hit Tab and it guesses what you mean, just like a modern mobile works out what you are typing).
</p>
<p>
See where I'm going with this?
</p>
<p>
While Russell points out that watching <i>Finding Nemo</i> on a telephone is pretty cool, I wonder if maybe the young person's preference for txt would extend to user interface.  What does it mean when I type '57' on my mobile keypad? Is it 'jp' or is it 'ls' the Unix directory-listing command? And the N-orth E-ast S-outh W-est of a text based <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_%28disambiguation%29">adventure</a> game would still work as M D P W. 
</p>
<p>
(And wouldn't any committed <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi">vi user</a> be happy with an even more modal interface?
</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>vi can frustrate new users, because it is a modal editor. A modal editor (or any modal program) assigns different meanings to buttons or keystrokes depending on which editing mode is active.</blockquote>
<p>
)
</p>
<p>
I'm not sure what Russell's application, the one that will get him out of his pyjamas and into the boardroom, will look like. But maybe it will be <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD">MUDlike</a>. I'd try to explain MUD's here but I can't. If you don't know follow the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD">link</a> to the Wikepedia and set aside a few hours...
</p>
<p>
(Interestingly that <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD">Wikipedia article</a> asserts that "Still others <a href="muds">MUDs</a>, especially those which are based on MOOs, are used in distance education or to allow for virtual conferences." But sadly it provides no links.)
</p>
<p>
Maybe the killer mobile app has a text based interface, and maybe it's a sort of MUDlike projection of meatspace into the virtual realm, a place you can wander about like an adept Systems Administrator using only the keypad with some very smart predictive software and a very well chosen vocabulary, chatting, fighting, making lurve, and leaving messages on the walls. 
</p>
<p>
Communicontent.
</p>
<p>
One of Russell's correspondents, commentors, whatever, <a class="external" href="http://the.taoofmac.com/space/blog/2004-11-07.13%3A17">says</a> "The limited UI, however, forces us to classify that user data and its dependencies, and to do that meta-data is essential." 
</p>
<p>
I dunno about this metadata stuff or nothin', but I don't think 'limited' is the way to think about it. If it's good enough for a teenager to make her preferred medium of communication then maybe it's <i>empowering</i>.

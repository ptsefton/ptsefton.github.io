I agree that these are important issues.

Now I and some collegues are asking ourselves how to blend the "learning
supply chain" and a collaborative approach to learning, and yes it does
mean we need to ignore the current consensus reality on what an LMS *is*
and what an LMS should *do*. I'm working with USQ's [Distance and
e-Learning Centre](http://www.usq.edu.au/dec/aboutdec/default.htm),
where we do have a supply chain. A good one. USQ is an experienced
distance educator, with a large corpus of materials that are evolving
from print to mixed-mode delivery. The evolution is nudged along by a
constant collaboration between teachers and instructional designers.

Essentially USQ's materials are *books*, even when they are online or on
CD. They have a beginning, a middle and an end and they are often
organised in a linear one-week-at-a-time kind of way. And in my opinion
there's nothing wrong with that as a *starting point* for online
collaboration. These materials work in a traditional distance education
mode, with more limited collaboration and interaction, so why not build
on them?

The approach I think we should take is to start from the established
materials which work as books, and use them to seed the collaboration
that is a hallmark of Internet-enabled educational processes.

We need to allow learner-constructed tagging to re-orient the materials
for a particular cohort.

We need to add browsing by structure, and interaction with the
structure:

-   Show me all the readings.

<!-- -->

-   Show me the readings I haven't read yet.

<!-- -->

-   Show me the activities I did but wanted to revist.

<!-- -->

-   Hey! Does anyone else think this definition here is wrong?

<!-- -->

-   Can I talk to someone else who has done this activity and had it
    work?

We need to add simple publishing tools to assist in collaborative
elaboration of the base materials.

And we need to close the loop on materials development. There should be
a short-cycle feedback loop allowing discussion and interaction in and
around course materials, and a way of rolling the interaction back into
course materials on a longer cycle.

Most importantly, we need to engage with the learners, even though this
whole business would be so much easier without them. Talking to Cameron
Loudon yesterday I was reminded that the evolution from book online to
collaborative learning experience needs to be taken in small steps that
are going to be good for the learners, the teachers and the
administrators, strictly in that order.

Hey Cam, where's your blog?

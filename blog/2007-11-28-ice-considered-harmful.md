ICE Considered Harmful

I lead a project at USQ that rejoices in the name <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>The Integrated Content Environment<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>, [ICE](http://ice.usq.edu.au/). We have
had great success at getting people at USQ to use the system for
[writing
courseware,](http://ptsefton.com/blog/2007/07/30/11-39-44.679295/) and
found that on the [RUBRIC](http://rubric.edu.au/) project it works well
as a project intranet. Any document can be pushed to the web by dropping
it into the project site, or [sent to a
blog](http://ice.usq.edu.au/presentations/demos/ooo_to_wordpress.htm)
via the Atom Publishing Protocol. There are several other great features
...

Hang on a minute. Why am I telling you this yet again? People at USQ
didn't use it because I told them to, they used it because it helped
them get the job done and they saw their colleagues using it. So I'm not
going to go on about how great ICE is any more, I'm here to tell you
that after the euphoria wears off depression will set in. And you will
think bugs are crawling under your skin, which is called
[formication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formication). Become an ICE
user and you will become even uglier and your teeth will fall out.

Welcome to my War on
[Ice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methamphetamine).

Here's picture I snapped of the back of a toilet door in the USQ
library, where the Australian Government is joining me in warning you
all about the dangers of [using word processor
styles](http://del.icio.us/ptsefton/usestyles) to make XTML.

I think I might be onto a trend here.

[Sun's HTML Project for OpenOffice.org is
stalled](http://ptsefton.com/2009/02/05/openofficeorg-is-bad-for-the-planet.htm),
as reported here a few days ago so I thought I'd catch up with IBM Lotus
Symphony and see how it's going. Last year I dashed off an excited blog
post when I discovered that it had avoided all the problems its
competition had with web export [by leaving that feature out
altogether](http://ptsefton.com/2008/01/25/ibm-lotus-symphony-word-processor-does-not-have-broken-html-export-like-all-the-others.htm).

I just installed the latest. A year on and web export has remained on
the cutting room floor (apart from presentations).

Seems like Sun and IBM might be onto some new post-web wave of
applications where all the action is in an offline cloud. If I'm right
about this we'll see Microsoft quietly dropping the blogging features
from Word along with Sharepoint web integration and all those other web
dead ends. Google docs will turn into Windows app and they'll get rid of
that browser based interface. Get in on the ground floor with this new
Web minus 3.0, offline-cloud computing meme and buy yourself some IBM
and Sun shares.

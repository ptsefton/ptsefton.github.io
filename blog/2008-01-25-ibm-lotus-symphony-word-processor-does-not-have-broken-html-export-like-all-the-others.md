I have complained here over and over about how bad word processors are
at producing HTML, at least until you see the light start using the [ICE
system](http://ice.usq.edu.au/) to style and convert your documents. I
documented some of the problems last year when I [looked
at](http://del.icio.us/ptsefton/xhtmlchallenge) how an author might fare
trying to write a paper for the web using Microsoft Word, OpenOffice.org
Writer or Google Docs.

But now I am delighted to report that IBM have solved this problem. The
latest [*IBM Lotus
Symphony*](http://symphony.lotus.com/software/lotus/symphony/home.jspa)
does not have the usual problems in its HTML export. No garbled code. No
messed up lists. No stupid attempts to reproduce paper formatting on the
web.

Why?

'Cos it has no HTML export at all.

Now I can <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>Be Free. Work Smart.<span

OK, so this is a beta release and I was running it on Ubuntu Linux which
is not supported. Maybe the final release will have spectacularly good
HTML export.

I didn't spend a lot of time with the word processor but I found it
confusing. Apparently it's based on an outdated version of
OpenOffice.org Writer with the menus moved around and renamed, possibly
to fit with the old Lotus way of doing things. Dig below the surface and
you can see the old OpenOffice.org dialogs in there, though.

Yesterday, the Australian Government decided to [share out some
money](http://www.dest.gov.au/Ministers/Media/Nelson/2005/08/n1173220805.asp):

> Australia’s research information infrastructure will be enhanced with
> today’s announcement that the Australian Government will invest a
> further \$19.4 million to fund nine projects under the Systemic
> Infrastructure Initiative (SII).

One of the the nine projects, described in [this Word
document](http://www.dest.gov.au/sectors/research_sector/policies_issues_reviews/key_issues/australian_research_information_infrastructure_committee/documents/outcomes_call_for_proposals_doc.htm)
(pretending to be a web page!) will be led by USQ:

> Regional Universities Building Research Infrastructure Collaboratively
> (RUBRIC) Lead Institution University of Southern Queensland
> \$3,872,700
>
> RUBRIC will develop infrastructure and capability across regional and
> smaller universities to maximise access to digital research resources.
> This project wishes to take on the best practice developed from the
> existing FRODO projects and develop similar institutional repositories
> in thirteen other universities. RUBRIC will provide a means for these
> institutions to work in a structured framework using the latest tools,
> to act collectively and to develop the expertise that will be
> necessary to respond to emerging needs of the Research Quality and
> Accessibility Frameworks across universities.
>
> Partners: University of New England, University of the Sunshine Coast,
> University of Newcastle (for the Intensive Research Universities of
> Australia), Massey University

FRODO?

That's described
[here](http://www.dest.gov.au/sectors/higher_education/programmes_funding/programme_categories/research_related_opportunities/systemic_infrastructure_initiative/callforproposals.htm):

> First Stage - Current Projects
>
> Four major demonstrator projects are directly related to addressing
> these goals, namely:
>
> **Meta Access Management System Project (MAMS) - MAMS will provide an
> essential "middleware" component to increase the efficiency and
> effectiveness of Australia’s higher education research information
> infrastructure. It will develop a new conceptual architecture which is
> capable of supporting multiple, independent models, and which is
> implemented locally within organisations, with the potential for
> inter-institutional communication.
> <http://www.melcoe.mq.edu.au/projects/MAMS/>**
>
> The Australian Research Repositories Online to the World (ARROW) -
> ARROW will identify and test a software solution or solutions to
> support best-practice institutional digital repositories comprising
> e-prints, digital theses and electronic publishing. It will develop a
> repository and associated metadata to support independent scholars
> (those not associated with institutions). <http://arrow.edu.au/>
>
> **Towards an Australian Partnership for Sustainable Repositories
> (APSR) - APSR will have an overall focus on the critical issues of the
> access, continuity and sustainability of digital collections. It will
> also build on a base of demonstrators for digital continuity and
> sustainability, embedded in developmental repository facilities within
> partner institutions. <http://apsr.edu.au/> and**
>
> Australian Digital Theses Program Expansion and Redevelopment (ADT) -
> ADT will redevelop the existing central metadata repository of the
> Australian Digital Theses Program (ADT) to increase its coverage and
> utility to the national and international research community. The
> repository’s content will expand to include metadata about all
> Australian higher degree theses.
> <http://adt.caul.edu.au/adtariic.html>
>
> Collectively these are called the Federated Repositories of Digital
> Objects (FRODO) projects.

I contributed a few words to the RUBRIC proposal that helped land this
funding, others did much, much more work. I'll introduce them later...

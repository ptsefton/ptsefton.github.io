I have posted about how to get versions of [OpenOffice.org for the
Mac](blog/2005/06/24/installing_openoffice_v2_(beta)_for_mac_os_x), to
run under the X 11 window system. Version 1.9.109 has crashed on me a
couple of times, but the recovery system means I have not lost too much
work.

The good news about this build, though, is that the Alt-key (option key)
works. This means that the Styles menu we set up in our templates as
part of the [ICE project](http://www.usq.edu.au/dec/staff/ice.htm) can
now be keyboard driven. I've been using an Alt-driven style menu for
five years now, mostly in Microsoft Word, and not having it on the Mac
was seriously frustrating.

It's worth learning keyboard shortcuts for formatting tasks in any
application on any platform. Helps the writing flow and improves the
quality of your typing, as you can leave the hands in place and not have
to reorient them after each mouse movement. The only minor issue with
Alt-S (for Styles) is that it means 'send' in Outlook. Not always good
to send half-finished emails.

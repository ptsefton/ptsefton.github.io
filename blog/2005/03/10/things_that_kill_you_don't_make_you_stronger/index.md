When I said to my girlfriend that I was writing a song called ''Things
that kill you don't make you stronger'' she said I was being like Jimmy
Buffett (but she likes Jimmy Buffett). But he obviously didn't say it
yet 'cos I listened to [Radio
Margaritaville](http://radiomargaritaville.com/) for hours and hours and
he never said it once.

But I'd better make sure. What would Jimmy Buffett do? Ask Google.

Your search - "Things that kill you don't make you stronger" - did not
match any documents.

Suggestions:

    - Make sure all words are spelled correctly.


    - Try different keywords.


    - Try more general keywords.

So maybe it ain't true yet.

I've been using Gmail as my non-work email client. I have it set up so
mail to my domains comes to me there. It's a vast improvement over
Yahoo. I told myself that I would endure the ads and never click on
them. But really, they have been useful.

I've recently had some behind-the-scenes changes to this site so I could
have a couple of extra domains, and Subversion and Trac installations
(more about that another time) for running the [WP Interop
project](http://ptsefton.com/wp_interop_project) and in the process of
that happening I was temporarily unable to login. But, while I was
sorting out the access problems Gmail showed me an ad for a *competitor*
of the ISP with whom I was corresponding. Maybe it read my frustration.
That was very instructive, 'cos the competitor's site was down
completely. I persevered here.

The other incident is not actually to do with ads, but with the Related
Pages Gmail suggests. I have been corresponding with someone about Word
to XHTML possibilities and Gmail suggested I read [Holes in Microsoft
Office XML](http://www.onlamp.com/pub/wlg/6649). This was really useful
because I thought I was subscribed to the O'Reilly weblogs via
[Bloglines](http://www.bloglines.com), but I'm pretty sure this one
never made it to me.

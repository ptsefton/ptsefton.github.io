[OpenOffice.org](http://openoffice.org) version 2 is now released. But
if you're using Mac OS X you still have to hunt-and-gather a version you
can use.

The best source I know of to date for and English version is not the
official download page but here:
<http://ooofr.org/telechargement/macosx/2.0/>. I have build 133 and it
works nicely.

<h1>Why do I keep going on about HTML export from word processors?</h1>

<div><style type="text/css">table {border-spacing: 0;empty-cells: show;} </style><p>I spend a lot of time on this site going on about HTML, particularly XHTML export from word processors<a href="http://ptsefton.com/blog/2005/03/02/use_styles"> using styles</a>. Why? Surely in 2005, when the mainstream use of the web is 10 years old, this is a solved problem?</p><p>It's not solved. </p><p>If you're using Microsoft Word or OpenOffice.org, or working with a community that uses both, can  you fire up the word processor, type out a document and export it as XHTML, or click a button to send it to your blog in useful XHTML?</p><p>If you can, I'd love to know how you do it. </p><p>I can, using the <a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/">ICE</a> software we're building at USQ – give or take a few teething problems. But for non ICE users?</p><p>Microsoft Word doesn't pretend to have XHTML export, so lets look at OpenOffice.org writer which does pretend. And I do mean pretend.</p><h2><a id="id1309675" name="id1309675"></a>OpenOffice.org Writer (X)HTML export</h2><p>My first experiment with OOo Writer was to try using the XHTML export on a document I had written using the ICE template. It had lots of lists in it. The XHTML export was awful, with list numbering all over the place. Why? Because the export stylesheet could not divine the structure implied by my styles and map that structure to XHTML. (And writer has this horrible mixture of list structures and paragraph styles that are sort-of tied together and very hard to work with in a consistent way.)</p><p>Oh, and the XTHML export that comes with OpenOffice doesn't do anything with image export. If you want the images then the best approach seems to be to also save as HTML, which gives you a result very very far from XHTML, then match the images between the two files (and resize the images, too, if you want reasonable performance because the HTML export pumps them all out at full-size and lets the browser do the resizing. We do it that way in the ICE project using Python code. Really.)</p><p>So the XHTML export didn't like my stylesheet. How would I go with the default template that comes with Writer? </p><p>I turned off my ICE template (File / Templates / Organize, select the templates folder and from the commands drop-down choose reset default template) and made a new document with the default. A bit of poking around and I found 'HTML styles' in the stylist. That looked promising. There were styles for <code>Heading 1...6</code>, <code>Preformatted Text,</code> <code>Quotations</code>. But what about lists? There's a thing called <code>List Content</code>. Apply that and you get not very much happening. Welcome to the wonderful world of lists in OpenOffice.org. You have to switch to the list styles that come built in. There are four list styles with bullets, List 1...4 the names don't tell you what kind of bullets you might get. There are four numbered list styles, Numbering 1...4 four of which are numbered 1...n and one of which is uppercase Roman numbering. How you would nest these lists inside each other is anybody's guess. </p><p>Got that? To apply a list style first apply List Contents from the paragraph styles, then switch to viewing  the list styles and guess which list might have the formatting you want. It would take me hours and hours to work out how to make decent XHTML using these crappy styles, and I'm a very patient, very experienced user of word processors. </p><p>Weirdness abounds. I can't begin describe to you the chaos that ensues when you start clicking on the list toolbar. Apply Numbering 4 style and you get something that starts with II (dunno why, since it is the first item) and then choose “Down one level” from the list toolbar and you get a sub-list that starts with III. It goes on and on, and you would need to do lots of exporting and peering at the result to work out what works and what doesn't.</p><p>I have no idea how to get these lists to nest, or to embed a list in a quote or embed preformatted text in a  bulleted list item. About all I could figure out quickly was that there is a button on the list toolbar that adds another paragraph to a list item.</p><p>The XTHML export was a bit better on this test document but instead of the problem being it not understanding my stylesheet it was the other way round.</p><h2><a id="id1310486" name="id1310486"></a>OpenOffice.org XHTML support sux</h2><p>I'd like someone to prove me wrong on this, but when Tim Bray <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/03/26/OpenOffice">said last year</a>:</p><blockquote class="bq">It turns out that OpenOffice already comes with a doohickey that will produce an XHTML approximation of most documents (Lauren tells me it’s shaky on tables)</blockquote><blockquote class="bqs"><a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/03/26/OpenOffice">http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/03/26/OpenOffice</a> </blockquote><p>he was really stretching credibility. I know Tim Bray doesn't spend much time in a word processing environment, but if he thought about it, he'd work out that no single stylesheet can map from something as flexible as the OpenDocument format to XHTML reliably. How could it possibly do something sensible with my custom stylesheet? And how on earth are  users supposed to use the built-in list styles? And what about images?</p><h2><a id="id1310514" name="id1310514"></a>The good news (if you're a geek)</h2><p>So what can you do to make XHTML from OpenOffice.org Writer (version 2) documents right now? (If you're technically minded and don't mind working with incomplete software):</p><ol class="lin"><li><p>Get the ICE template; <code>ice.ott.</code> You'll find it under the downloads section at  <a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/browser/ice/downloads/">http://ice.usq.edu.au/browser/ice/downloads/.</a> The current latest version is:</p><p><a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/file/ice/downloads/0.2/beta/templates/ice.ott">http://ice.usq.edu.au/file/ice/downloads/0.2/beta/templates/ice.ott</a></p><p>The ICE template works with styles, available from a <code>Styles</code> menu, which is organized into things like headings, lists, inline (character) styles. In most cases you need only apply a single paragraph style using this menu.</p></li><li><p>You can use the style sheets from ICE, by adding them as an export filter.</p><ol class="lia"><li><p>Download the XSLT stylesheets and save them in a directory together somewhere.</p></li><li><p>Set up a new export filter in Writer. (Won't do images but it will work better than the built in one)</p><ul class="lib"><li><p>From the Tools menu, choose XML Filter Settings...</p></li><li><p>Click New to create a new filter. </p><dl><dt>Filter name</dt><dd>test</dd><dt>Application</dt><dd>OpenOffice.org Writer</dd><dt>File extenstion</dt><dd>xhtml</dd></dl></li></ul><dl><dd></dd></dl></li><li><p>Point the new filter at the <code>XSLT for Export </code>on the <code>Transformation</code> tab.</p></li><li><p>OK that. (You don't need to specify a DTD for this project, you can still validate because the stylesheet takes care of the XML declaration that declares the document to be XHTML).</p></li><li><p>Click the <code>Test XSLTs </code>button and then <code>Current document</code>  to see the result of the transform (which is just the same as running the <code>office2html.xsl</code> stylesheet at this stage).</p></li></ol></li></ol><p>Or, you can grab the ICE stylesheet now and start working, then get ICE in a few days when we release Mac OS X 10.4 and Windows compatible binaries. ICE can sit there watching a directory of content for you, and keep it under version control using Subversion.</p><p>Or, wait a bit longer until we, or some other kind team, package just the OpenDocument to XHTML part of ICE as a stand-alone bit of code.</p><p></p><p></p><p><b></b></p></div>

Yesterday I presented a [tutorial on WordProcessing and
XML](http://www.openpublish.com.au/program.asp?myCategory=PresentationDetail&myPresID=183).
This is some homework.

First of all, I need to look in to Adobe
[InDesign](http://www.adobe.com/products/indesign/main.html), which is a
desktop (and server) publishing application which is tipped to succeed
both PageMaker and FrameMaker. There is at least one vendor here at Open
Publish showing off a system that uses InDesign as the rendering end of
a publishing process, where authors work in word processors, but I
haven't seen it in detail yet. I'll investigate InDesign further, with
the publishing team at USQ.

Secondly, there are a couple of omissions in my notes.

-   My favorite way of exporting XML from Microsoft Word by transforming
    the broken HTML export format into well formed XML is described here
    in [this article on
    xml.com](http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/12/08/word-to-xml.html).

-   A similar approach is taken by this [commercial
    package](http://www.docsoft.com/w2xmlv2.text.htm). I am dubious
    about some of the claims they make, though. This makes it sound a
    bit too easy: "You can also export to practically any Schema you
    wish by using W2XML's abilities to capture named styles within
    Word." I think mapping styles to XML is sometimes quite complex and
    frequently cannot be automated completely.

    Jones' blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/brian_jones/default.aspx).

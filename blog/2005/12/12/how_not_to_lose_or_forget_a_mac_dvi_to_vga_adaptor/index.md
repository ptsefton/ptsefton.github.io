The PowerBook I use requires a DVI to VGA adaptor to work with most
monitors. That's ok, but you have to take it with you if you are going
to do a presentation, as most places the projector is VGA only. I've
been good so far, but last week I managed to leave it at home when I had
a presentation to do at work. Found out with about fifteen minutes to
go.

I was able to find two adaptors within ten minutes, 'cos it was my home
campus, but if it had been out on the road I may not have been so lucky.
Thanks Chris and Scott.

Now I have tied it to the neoprene sleeve (by
[STM](http://www.streetwise.com.au/product_info.php?products_id=1855&osCsid=fe9887951f3710c81517c0ad17a16c3c&osCsid=fe9887951f3710c81517c0ad17a16c3c))
that goes everywhere the PowerBook goes, just by jamming it through the
zipper-pull cord. I will never, ever take it out of there.

Title: "Extreme meta agility"

I like the generic term [Agile software
development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)
better than the cringe-worthy [Extreme
Programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_Programming) (XP) but
whatever you call it we're getting back into it at work.

One of the things I remember from reading about XP a few years ago was
the bit about, if a certain practice is good you should do it all the
time: 'turn up all the knobs to 11', which seems to me to be
metaphorically opposed to the 'driving a car' approach to planning which
emphasizes steering, making adjustments, not pressing the accelerator as
far as it will go or turning up the stereo until it distorts and you go
deaf from the SHOUTING.

This wext week we kick off a new project which we're calling the
"Integrated Courseware Environment". The first requirements are to do
with easy-to-use front end for our XML based courseware system, if that
goes well maybe we will be able to tackle some broader issues in the
learning-systems space later.

The team members have worked with bits and pieces of XP before. I have
used an adapted version and the others researched it last year.

We don't have a lot of time to research the process again so I was
pleasantly surprised to revisit [Extreme Programming: A Gentle
Introduction today](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/index.html) and
find that this little site is a clear reminder of what to do.

And it seems that there is a more meta-agile flavor to the Extreme
programming cult now than the old 'do all these things at full volume
approach':

> This new version has more advice in the form of principles and

> know what is good?
>
> Gone is the restrictive notion that Extreme Programming is a limited

> responsibility for improvement.

But is it getting more cult-like? Values? Really? What are our values?
Cynical people might well ask "What is your job description?" We'll
order the book and have a read.

Anyway, our rough plan is to follow as many of the 'rules' as we can
without too much stress or having to hit the books to work out how
(don't worry we can already do unit testing, automated builds,
refactoring and related stuff). But we want to keep a list of other
things to try that we can throw into the mix as we go.

The first thing? Like the site says, we need to run a couple of
iterations to see what our velocity is. I think I see a transition from
a process where we start by estimating and prioritizing user stories but
we don't *promise* how much we will get done in an iteration, to a
process where we can estimate well enough to take on the right amount of
work, and build trust with the customers and stakeholders. I'll report
progress here. I already have one cynic wanting to see how we go with
pair programming in practice, we'll see.

And we're thinking about [this
advice](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/6364) from Rick Jelliffe,
adding in the things he mentions here that we have not yet done and
monitoring their effectiveness:

> An approach I took a few years back, which I think is pretty workable

> control system, periodic scheduled audits for i18n, accessibility,
> memory profiling, and usability, a skills-enhancement program, an Open
> Source library research effort, and so on.) Then cut back on the ones
> that are not providing value compared to their cost, and ramp up the
> ones that give bang per buck.

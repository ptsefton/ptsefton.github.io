I have been puzzling over the purpose of
[StarOffice](http://www.sun.com/software/star/staroffice/index.xml),
which is Sun's not-free version of the OpenOffice.org office suite. Last
time I looked, there was little on Sun's site to explain what you get
from StarOffice (better spelling support? more clipart?) beyond a range
of support contracts you can purchase, which could be (are?) also
offered for OpenOffice.org. But earlier this year at a Sun sponsored
event I attended they were pushing StarOffice for universities. It's
free for academic use! Well so is OpenOffice.org.

Why push StarOffice over OpenOffice.org? I don't know.

Why push one or the other I do understand. Shifting large numbers of
people to an alternative to Microsoft Office would be a big win for
alternative operating systems, of which Sun has at least two in their
Linux based and Solaris offerings. Microsoft Office is one of the main
applications that drives Windows sales.

But splitting the market with two offerings where one, StarOffice, is an
older, less talked about more costly, version of the other?

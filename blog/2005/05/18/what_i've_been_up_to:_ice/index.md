Since I joined USQ, on contract, I have worked on a few things, but
there's one main project that we have been developing. Now that there's
a page on the USQ web site it seems more real. It's the [Integrated
Content Environment](http://www.usq.edu.au/dec/staff/ice.htm) - ICE.

> The ICE project builds on past work in both computer applications and
> business processes to provide a unified system by which authors,
> editors and instructional designers from across the University can
> collaborate on the creation of learning materials, original research,
> and administrative material, including messaging and discussion.
>
> The ICE project has two main components. Firstly, there is a content
> authoring system designed to supplement the GOOD system with an
> easy-to-use word-processor based application. Secondly, there is a
> web-based application designed to tie together all of the other
> systems and resources that USQ staff need to engage in courseware
> authoring and to manage materials and interaction.

Peter Albion of USQ proposed an intriguing model of publishing in a
conversation we had some time ago. I prompted him to [write it
up](http://edux.usq.edu.au/~albion/weblog/index.php?p=51). Peter notes
that USQ's current courseware dilutes authorship as a course is revised
over time, and the rewards of writing coursware are less than for
writing research paper. He proposes a new model in which indivdiual
academics would publish, and courses would be constructed out of those
published materials.

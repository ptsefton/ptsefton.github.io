Justine Larbalestier, who is an *actual published author* I know has a
[blog](http://www.justinelarbalestier.com/blog/) - Justine got a mention
here
[before](http://ptsefton.com/blog/2004/08/02/the_best_thing_about_blogs).
For some reason she has added a link to this site in her 'roll of
blogs' - probably as a cruel joke at the expense of her readers, who
will be assaulted with technobabble and pink and yellow when they are
used to clever, cultured musings.

So just to cushion to the shock to those arriving here I'll say
something literary. And I'll put a literature link in the menu under
themes to point to this. And if I ever decide to read a book, then I'll
seriously consider reading [Magic or
Madness](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1595140220/qid=1117103031/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/002-7971900-5191239?v=glance&s=books&n=507846)
by Justine Larbalestier.

Justine's blog has no capital letters in it, which reminded me of *my*
book - which I typed out in the early nineties some time, got three
friends to read, entered in a literary prize and then shelved when I
didn't win. I wrote it because I was pissed off at a book that had won
the prize a year or two before.

In my book I had invented a particularly loathsome character called "the
hippie" who didn't use capital letters, except when I forgot that she
wasn't meant to. She was more like a bit of furniture than a character,
really. Not like Justine, but if she keeps up this all lower case stuff,
who knows?

This bit is at a drunken party/meeting in a bedroom:

> "Hey, youse. I've got an idea."

> "Lets all pick a book that we think is relevant to the film. Then

>
> "I'm not reading the book the hippie picks. Or Rose. Or yours Bruce,"
> said Mary.

> This didn't deter the hippie, who said, "i pick all of the great

> gita, the karma sutra, and â€¦ i forget the others. great stuff."
>
> "See?" said Mary. "I told you all so." She swept an arm expansively
> and inaccurately around the bed to make her point. "The hippie picked

>
> "i don't need to, mary. i am in touch with the spiritual planes

>
> "I've read that lot anyway, or bits thereof," Mary told her, lying.
> "And maybe quorum does not mean what you think it means."

### Enterprise content management using Word Processors

Presenter: Peter Sefton

This tutorial presents techniques for working with XML using word
processing applications, particularly Microsoft Word and OpenOffice.org
Writer, but with some reference to Adobe FrameMaker and other
applications.

Following a general survey of formats and techniques the tutorial looks
in detail at a common use-case where organizations want single-source
documents to generate both print and web output. We show how to avoid
the use of custom schemas and expensive customization, but still reap
the benefits of XML: having your content in non-proprietary formats,
being able to create, re-format, re-purpose and re-use content cheaply,
into the future.

You will learn:

-   When to consider using a word processor in an XML project and why
-   The basics of the XML formats and capabilities offered by Word
    processors
-   Why word processors' built in HTML export is never adequate
-   How to set your expectations, including some lessons from the past
    that you do not want to repeat
-   How to use word processor features such as styles, master documents,
    autotext and tables in a way that will give you good quality XML
    output, and what to avoid
-   How to produce both PDF and HTML output from a single source
    document using OpenOffice.org and/or Word
-   How to obtain and adapt open-source templates and software
-   How to source technical assistance to implement a full system

Prerequisite: Some familiarity with word processing software is
essential.

The tutorial will cover some technical topics to help implementers get
started and to give managers an appreciation of the issues involved.

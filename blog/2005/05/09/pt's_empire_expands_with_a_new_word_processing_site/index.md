I now have a new site for Word Processor stuff, a place to keep open
source code, templates and documentation. It's at
<http://trac.officecontent.net>. It uses Trac, which I'm still [liking a
lot](blog/2005/03/07/trac).

Word Processor Interop stuff including template downloads and notes will
move there from here when it gets around to it.

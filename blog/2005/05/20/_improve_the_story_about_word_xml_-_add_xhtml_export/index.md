I agree that the Microsoft Office XML story needs some bolstering. Or is
it that the *product* needs bolstering?

For Word I would love to see complete working XML applications for XHTML
and Docbook. XHTML particularly. There still doesn't seem to be a Word
based XHTML application out there that I would hand to a user.

Or can't it be done in Microsoft Word using the inbuilt XML tools?

If it's not practical using the XML editing tools - how about an XHTML
application for Word based on styles. We're working on *that* at
[OfficeContent](http://trac.officecontent.net/wiki/WpInteropStyles).
Would Microsoft like to assist?

Jon Udell suggested a style-based solution in his
[review](http://www.infoworld.com/article/03/10/03/39FEoffice_2.html) of
Office 2003:

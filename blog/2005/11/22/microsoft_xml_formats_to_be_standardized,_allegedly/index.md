Microsoft are [now
claiming](http://blogs.msdn.com/brian_jones/archive/2005/11/21/495466.aspx)
(via Bran Jones who works on the Office team) that their new Office XML
format will be put throught the ISO standards process. Something had to
give - it was either this or adding support for OpenDoument to Office
and this will keep a bit more distance between MS Office and
OpenOffice.org.

(I wonder if the the ISO Standard will only come pakaged as a Windows
executable, the way their preview release of the Microsoft XML schema
for Word did? :)

If the formats do turn into capital-S Standards, and the licensing
conditions on the shemas are truly open then this opens the way for Word
documents to be considered for inclusion in sustainable digital
repositories, provided two things happen:

-   There is reliable, free code that can render the documents that can
    be archived with them.

<!-- -->

-   There are templates that ensure interoperability with other word
    processors, and/or XML schemas. That is, the documents use the core
    of the standard, which is compatible with OpenDocument, XHTML,
    DocBook and so on.

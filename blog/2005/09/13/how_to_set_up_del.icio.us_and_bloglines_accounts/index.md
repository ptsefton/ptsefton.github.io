I recently wrote about using del.icio.us in the RUBRIC project. My
colleague Deidre Lowe wrote up all the steps she had to go through to
set up del.icio.us and use blogines to track it.

I'm reproducing Deidre's instructions here with permission, as they're a
lot better than my vague handwaving exhortations to go and sign up for
del.icio.us and bloglines.

(She's using Internet Explorer on Windows, your mileage may vary if you
are using a different browser.)

Purpose

:   To explain how to use Bloglines and del.icio.us to monitor tagged
    information relevant to the RUBRIC project for the purposes of
    professional development.

Scope

:   RUBRIC Project Team (and the rest of the world).

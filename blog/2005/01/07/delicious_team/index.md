I speculated a while ago about [delicious](http://del.icio.us)-style
[tagging for an intranet](blog/2004/08/23/tasty-intranet), using
lightweight tagging to replace the somewhat heavier metadata system in
the company Intranet where I was working. I'm not quite up to building
that yet, but today a related topic: using del.icio.us and aggregators
to share bookmarks, with annotations, between team members.

At work we have a small team working on a few streams of development and
maintenance. Today we set up a del.icio.us based system. Individuals
will create a del.icio.us account, and when they're researching a
work-related topic they can keep a record in del.icio.us.

The 'official' tags we'll be using are:

-   [decsdt](http://del.icio.us/tag/decsdt) The Distance and e-Learning
    Centre Software Development Team.

<!-- -->

-   [usqgood](http://del.icio.us/tag/usqgood) Relates to the
    multi-output in-house XML course publishing system.

<!-- -->

-   [usqgoodlite](http://del.icio.us/tag/usqgoodlite) Relates to
    lightweight XML editing systems that could be used with the above.

<!-- -->

-   [usqlms](http://del.icio.us/tag/usqgood) Stuff relevant to Learning
    Management Systems in the USQ context.

Using del.icio.us means (a) it could disappear at any time so we'd
better have a backup strategy (b) it's public. This means that if any of
our friends want to send us a link they need only use one of the above
tags in del.icio.us and we'll see it, because we'll all be watching
those tags, much simpler than sending an email, and more persistent. (If
people start using this to sell us pharmaceuticals or to help get money
out of Africa, we can always circle the wagons and subscribe only to
trusted feeds.)

So far we have two participants. If it works for the nuclear team, then
we'll talk to a wider group.

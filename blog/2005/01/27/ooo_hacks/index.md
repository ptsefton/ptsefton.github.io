Title: "Hacking OpenOffice article on XML.com"

I have another article up on [xml.com](http://www.xml.com), this time
about [OpenOffice.org hacks for template
maintainers](http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2005/01/26/hacking-ooo.html). It's
a how-to for XML-savvy types who want to administer templates via the
back-door instead of the GUI. I see this as an essential step in my
quest for a proper set of templates and tools for 'doing' XML (mainly
XHTML) in word processors. While Microsoft Word also has XML export, I'd
rather concentrate on OO.o first because it's open, free and runs on
more platforms.

I'd like to thank [Rick
Jelliffe](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/1712). Rick helped me by
offering advice on how to get published in the first place and how to
improve on my first article on [Word to
XML](http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/12/08/word-to-xml.html), suggesting
sidebars to point out tips and tricks (which there are a lot of in the
word processor world, where software tends to be fairly opaque).

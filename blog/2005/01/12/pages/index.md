Title: "Pages? Not web pages."
Slug: pages

Word processing applications for the web are a bit of a
[theme](http://del.icio.us/ptsefton/ptsefton+wpinterop) here. So this
announcement from [Apple on the new 'Pages'
application](http://www.apple.com/iwork) announced at Macworld was of
interest. Not to mention I might be getting a PowerBook soon.

Not impressed so far.

Introducing 'Pages', which has name that suggests it might be built for
the web. But no:

> The easiest way to look good on paper, Pages lets you create documents
> that look like you had a design team working round the clock. But, no,
> it's just you, taking advantage of a new word processor with great
> style, an easy-to-use powerhouse that gives you all the tools you need
> to create superb-looking documents.

Did you get that? "The easiest way to look good on paper". Search the
iWork page for 'web'. Nup.

Not a single mention of writing for or creating presentations for the
web. There are no instances of the string 'web' or 'html' on that page.

At least it does mention styles, and does make a big deal about
templates.

But I am disappointed that Apple are not talking about how to make
gorgeous paper documents and gorgeous web documents from the same
source; *that* would be impressive.

I was hoping for the mythical word processor for the web that Tim Bray
[talked about last
year](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/07/20/AuthoringPain).

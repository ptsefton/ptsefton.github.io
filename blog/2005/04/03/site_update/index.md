I have updated this site to use [Leonardo](http://jtauber.com/leonardo)
v0.5. I was running a hacked version of 0.3 before, so there could be
breakages. The only hack I've done to this one is to redirect the RSS
feed I added to Leonardo to a SmartFeed at
[feedburner.com](http://feedburner.com), which is
[apparently](http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008359.html) a good
way to keep track of what people do when they read the site via a feed.
I'd appreciate email (pt at ptsefton.com) if you notice any problems.

The other day I [wrote
about](blog/2005/05/24/trac,_rss,_subversion,_openoffice.org_getting_stuff_done)
how the RSS aggregator I've been using to efficiently surf the web
brought important tasks to my attention. This is, of course, not much of
an insight. Aggregating things is what aggregators do.

Only they don't really, yet they work mainly on finding things, with
some options for responding. But the aggregator should be able to shift
some items from the stream of stuff that gets scanned and read and
discarded, into tasks, into the calendar, into the [collaborative
bookmarking](http://del.icio.us) system. This got me daydreaming about
writing an aggregator that would allow you to read an item and turn it
into a task, or a attach it to the calendar as a reminder; to name two
things that I want to do not just with tasks, but with web stuff.

And then my aggregator [reminded
me](http://blogs.osafoundation.org/mitch/000923.html) about Chandler, an
ambitious open source undertaking to build an information manager, which
is apparently well on the way to being useful. The versions I downloaded
to try on this OS X machine won't run, and I don't have time to muck
around with them, but I will stay tuned - and try to remember not to get
all carried away about writing Chandler myself.

Maybe one of the Microsoft Outlook based aggregators would come closest
to Chandler now?

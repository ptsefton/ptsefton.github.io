At the eResearch Australasia conference last week I attended a Birds of
a Feather session, [Authorisation community
developments](http://www.eresearch.edu.au/2009bof08) run by Markus
Buchhorn (Intersect), Lyle Winton (Victorian eResearch Strategic
Initiative), Clare Sloggett (Intersect) and Neil Witheridge (ARCS).
Clare asked me to come along, possibly because she knew I had been
critical of some aspects of the Australian Access Federation machinery
and how it is supposed to work. I am pleased to report, though that it
sounds like some things have changed for the better.

About a year ago, I addressed the ARROW repository community about the
then-new Object Reuse and Exchange (ORE) standard. I [started with a
slightly belligerent rant about another standard,
XACML](http://ptsefton.com/2008/10/14/what-the-oai-ore-protocol-can-do-for-you.htm#id4)
(eXtensible Access Control Markup Language). XACML was supposed to be a
part of how the Australian Access Federation
([AAF](http://www.aaf.edu.au/)) was supposed to allow all of us in the
Australian Higher-Education and research community to access each
other's stuff based on our *roles*.

Back then [I
noted](http://ptsefton.com/2008/10/14/what-the-oai-ore-protocol-can-do-for-you.htm#id4)
the difficulty with defining role attributes in a way that would work
cross-institution:

(I finally have an answer for Kent about what an anthropologist is. Read
on.)

My previous understanding of how the AAF would work was that my host
organisation would have to be solely responsible for asserting stuff
about me, who I was and what roles I had, because there was no publicly
shareable identifier to allow other people to assert things about me,
such as that they trusted me to look at some data or edit a document.
This meant that simple, obvious use-cases like a group of ethnographers
setting up a collaboration space by asking each other for their login
names would not be possible; due to privacy concerns there would be a
unique ID for each AAF person but **there would be no sharing**.

I'm pleased to report that things have changed and the AAF now **does
encourage the use of public shareable IDs**. So a few points occur to
me. The first couple I raised at the BoF, the last one came later.

1.  This means we can **let people self-organise** by adding white-lists
    of known IDs to their systems. An institution might not be a
    reliable way to sort the anthropologists from the ethnographers, but
    they can sort themselves out all right and form whatever working
    groups they want.

2.  It was noted at the BoF that some people would have more than one
    AAF ID, I suggested that it might be good to **register these in the
    new researcher ID system** that I believe is being set up at the
    National Library as part of the [ANDS](http://ands.org.au/)
    infrastructure. I think this new NLA system will be what Nick
    Nicholas calls an [Identifier Assertion
    Hub](http://blog.linkaffiliates.net.au/2009/10/23/approaches-to-fluid-identity-identifier-assertion-hubs/).

3.  There was some talk of **systems that could manage groups of AAF
    users**. This answers the bigest problem I had with the AAF not
    being able to work with ad-hoc or user-defined communities, only
    with role attributes assigned by the home identity provider.

    Following from this I finally worked out how to answer Kent's
    question <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>what's an
    anthropologist<span class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>. An (Australian)
    anthropologist is someone who's a member of the he [Australian
    Anthropological Society](http://www.aas.asn.au/).

    In an identity federation that does include public, shareable
    identifiers, societies could publish lists of members or run a
    group-server that could be used by other services.

Finally, I can't help commenting that if we're going to have a
federation where a lot of the trust relationships are devolved to the
users, allowing them to assemble groups, or to societies like the AAS
then maybe we should consider allowing the use of
[OpenId](http://openid.net/) as well as or instead of
[Shibboleth](http://shibboleth.internet2.edu/). I bet not everyone in
the AAS has an institutional login at an AAF member, even once the AAF
is fully operational with wall to wall Shibboleth, but anyone can get an
OpenId.

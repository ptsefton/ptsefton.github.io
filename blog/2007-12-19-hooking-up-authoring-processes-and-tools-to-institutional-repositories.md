Last week we held a workshop at USQ where I invited a bunch of
developers to come, gave them a vague theme and set them loose. The
process seems to have worked well. I figured that if invited good
developers, and asked them to bring a laptop then we would end up with
some code and integrate a few things that have been going on in their
own little silos.

I was right.

See the [summary that I wrote with Daniel de
Byl](http://ice.usq.edu.au/blog/?p=105)over on the ICE blog <span

feeds to subscribe and see the forthcoming screencast demos.

On the Slashdots today there was some stuff about how [spreadsheets are
evil and MUST NOT BE USED FOR RESEARCH
EVER](http://science.slashdot.org/story/14/05/27/220202/why-you-shouldnt-use-spreadsheets-for-important-work).

This is really sad. Instead of ranting about what’s wrong with office
software, why aren’t the smart kids (ie us) working on ways to make it
better? Surely one could develop some tooling to make code-review in
spreadsheets better rather than complaining? Spreadsheets do not allow
testing? Why don’t we make sure they do?

Anyway, the fact that this Piketty posted the data and the code, and
others can re-run everything is the whole point of what we’re trying to
do in eResearch. Matlab or R code could dodgy too. We want to maximise
research integrity and impact. To maximise integrity, show your working
out, listen to feedback, fix problems. Repeat.

The really sad bit? *This* is not constructive:

> [Piketty used spreadsheets instead of writing *sane*
> software](http://lemire.me/blog/archives/2014/05/23/you-shouldnt-use-a-spreadsheet-for-important-work-i-mean-it/)

*Sane* software? Really? You think the *software* has mental health
issues?

Me, I think the hard-core tech community has a real attitude problem.
Maybe the text-file-comandline-distributed-version-control-way is the
One True Way. If so do you think ranting about 'sane software' is the
best way to win people over? Another way might be to, you know, try to
think up a way to use spreadsheets in a *sane* way Or you could Show us
the Code (ie post your own *sane* version).

Another example: just this week I’ve been playing with docpad, a
promising looking website toolkit. Gotta love its
[about](http://docpad.org/docs/intro) page:

> WYSIWYG editors are *sucky and stupid* - why re-invent the wheel?
> We're already trained with and love our desktop counterparts (Sublime
> Text, Vim, Byword, etc.)

Just between you and me, docpad itself turns out to be ‘sucky and
stupid’ if you give it more than a few hundred pages to chew on, but I
wouldn't post that on the internet, I'd turn up at their github site and
suggest a solution to the embarrassing out-of-memory issues (hint, maybe
you do actually want to fire up a database or index of some kind kids).

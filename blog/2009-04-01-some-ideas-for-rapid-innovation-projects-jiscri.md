Some ideas for our friends in the UK for the [JISC Rapid Innovation
call](http://www.jisc.ac.uk/fundingopportunities/funding_calls/2009/03/309ricall.aspx).

> JISC invites institutions to submit funding proposals for grants to
> fund technical rapid innovation projects addressing priority areas.
>
> Proposals are sought under the following priority areas:
>
> -   Mashups of open data
>
> -   Aggregating tags and feeds
>
> -   Semantic web/ linked data
>
> -   Data search
>
> -   Visualisation
>
> -   Personalisation
>
> -   Mobile Technologies
>
> -   Lightweight Shared Infrastructure Services
>
> -   User Interface Design
>
> Bids for projects dealing with other areas that are relevant to the
> Information Environment are also welcomed.
>
> Funding of between <span class="spCh spChxa3">£</span>15,000 - <span
> class="spCh spChxa3">£</span>40,000 for 6 month projects for up to 30
> projects is available

> <span class="Strong_20_Emphasis">12 noon on Wednesday 22 April

We'd be happy to help out with projects like the ones I am rattling off
here.

# <span id="id1"></span><!--id1--></a>1 Mashups of open data

Why not give [Tony Hirst](http://ouseful.wordpress.com/) <span
class="spCh spChxa3">£</span>40,000 to go on holiday somewhere without a
net connection, giving someone else a chance to (a) read all his blog
posts about mashups, which would consume about 5 months and (b) spend
the last month doing the one or two things Tony has not already mashed
up.

# <span id="id2"></span><!--id2--></a>2 Aggregating tags and feeds

Well, we could invest six months in the [Lazy
Lecturer](http://miaridge.com/projects/lazylecturer/about.php) thing
(which was [shortlisted for the dev8D
prize](http://openobjects.blogspot.com/2009/03/yay-three-lazy-geeks-shortlisted-for.html)).
It's all about tagging, then aggregating and munging resources that were
tagged, then re-publishing them back to the web.

# <span id="id3"></span><!--id3--></a>3 Semantic web/ linked data

## <span id="id4"></span><!--id4--></a>3.1 Authoring tools

How about a really simple approach to getting linked data going for
documents. In six months you could easily do one or more of the
following three things:

1.  Add user pages to a repository and/or ePortfolio system and/or staff
    phone book that can be used to assert authorship. So, in addition to
    a page at ePrints like [this one that shows
    publications](http://eprints.usq.edu.au/view/people/Sefton=3APeter=3A=3A.html)<span
    class="footnote">[1](#ftn0)</span> there would be one which
    formally, explicitly states that linking to it asserts that I am an
    author. Then all I need to do in a paper is link whatever variant of
    my name I am using to that page.

2.  Get as many onotologies online as possible and set up similar
    linkable pages for them. See [the discussion
    here](http://ptsefton.com/2009/03/27/more-on-microsoft-collaboration-and-word-processor-interop.htm),
    sparked by Glyn Moody's concerns about the Microsoft Ontology add-in
    for Word. I said:

    > **Why couldn<span class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>t** [**the
    > ontology add-in**](http://ucsdbiolit.codeplex.com/) **(which**
    > **is a good idea, don<span class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>t get me
    > wrong) store data using the simplest most robust method possible;
    > using a link?**
    >
    > <span class="spCh spChx2026">…</span> Geonames.org provides a
    > linked-data endpoint for
    > [Toowoomba](http://www.geonames.org/2146268/toowoomba.html). See
    > what I did there? I linked to it. And look how you can [get
    > RDF](http://sws.geonames.org/2146268/about.rdf). That will survive
    > round tripping between Word and OpenOffice.org, saving as HTML,
    > saving as .doc, sending to a publisher, and it<span
    > class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>s perfectly usable without an
    > add-in. Could someone explain to me why you would need to use
    > custom XML here given the simplicity, robustness and
    > interoperability of the alternative?

3.  Make a new Zotero plugin for one or more of Word / Writer /
    GoogleDocs / WordPress which can turn plain old links into
    citations. Why do we have to go through all this finding a page,
    putting it in Zotero then using the insert citation button, why not
    teach people to find good endpoints and link to them then let the
    machine sort out all the rest of it, harvesting metadata if
    necessary and formatting citations and bibliographies. A modern
    journal could let the reader choose what bibliography style they
    want, and let them import all the references from a paper into their
    own reference manager.

## <span id="id6"></span><!--id6--></a>3.2 Publishing tools

Or, for the publishers rather than the authors, why not put in place a
demonstration issue of a [<span style="font-style:normal; "><span
class="T5">Scholarly
HTML</span></span>](http://ptsefton.com/2009/03/31/scholarly-html.htm)
journal, with linkable paragraphs and mineable data courtesy of embedded
microformats. Maybe Ariadne at UKOLN? This would look a bit like the
[winner of the Elsevier Article 2.0
competition](http://surguy.net/bricks/elsevier/00012998/0036/0001/05000486/about.html).

Or for a bit more of a challenge someone could have a go at [integrating
ICE with OJS as per this suggestion of
mine](http://ptsefton.com/2009/01/06/potential-projects-2-integrating-ice-with-the-open-journal-systems.htm).

## <span id="id7"></span><!--id7--></a>3.3 Collaborative tools

See [this
proposal](http://ptsefton.com/2009/01/05/potential-projects-1-a-general-purpose-document-annotation-system.htm)
of mine for a general purpose annotation system. Could be very useful to
JISC from what I hear about the marking process. Just saying. There are
some nice interface ideas at the Article 2.0 winner, which does not
appear to be available under an open source license.

# <span id="id8"></span><!--id8--></a>4 Other

It turns out that the Moodle VLE/LMS we use at USQ doesn't have a proper
full-text search system. One very useful project would be to hook up
Moodle via some kind of feed system to a faceted search service which
could index all the content, discussions and course metadata. [The
Fascinator](http://fascinator.usq.edu.au/) would be a good base for this
as it could cover security if you want to restrict people to just the
courses they are enrolled in, but also potentially allow people to
discover where there is content that they are not enrolled in. Even
better, you could throw repository content in the index as well and
associate it with course codes.

Less than two weeks ago I posted here on what I called the [Desktop
eRearch
revolution.](http://ptsefton.com/2009/03/05/desktop-eresearch-revolution.htm)
Jim Richardson gave that resulting discussion the twitter tag \#DTeRrev.
You can [see what people said](http://twitter.com/search?q=%23DTeRrev).

Since then we went ahead with the idea <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> Oliver Lucido has put together a version
of The Fascinator that can index a hard drive and show it too you
faceted by file type and by metadata. He started with mp3 files because
they contain metadata, but the goal is to work with research data of all
kinds.

We are going to be working initially with history data belonging to
Leonie Jones <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> the goal will be to
get the application to index and label her stuff, be able to back it up
appropriately and/or send it to a public memory repository with
appropriate access controls so the public get the bit they're meant to
see and not the bit they are not meant to see.

Oliver's work is not quite ready for others to try out yet but he will
be making it part of the existing install any minute now which means it
will be easy to try out on \*nix systems like Linux or Mac OS X. No
Windows installer yet, sorry but Duncan Dickinson is looking into it.

Duncan made a new web site for [The
Fascinator](http://fascinator.usq.edu.au/). I have taken the feedback we
got here and via Twitter and created an
[FAQ](http://fascinator.usq.edu.au/faq/desktop-faq.htm) page. There are
a couple of things still to add to that including:

1.  Will it index email? (Ian Barnes) Good idea <span
    class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> probably would be great to reposit
    the email that goes along with a project with the other project
    materials.

2.  Can it mint persistent identifiers? (Neil Dickson) Answer: Maybe,
    but the desktop is not really the place for persistence which is the
    reason for this application so maybe that should happen downstream.
    But certainly *unique identifiers* would make sense as an easy to
    deploy solution for giving things provisional names across versions
    of the same object (which we will tell apart by using hashes).

[Update: Andrew Treloar points out that he uses OpenOffice.org and I see
that his feedreader (Thunderbird) does not render blockquotes <span

quote. And I forgot the link!]

Things are different at USQ, though, because we are actively encouraging
people to use OpenOffice.org. For one thing, you have to have it
installed to use [ICE](http://ice.usq.edu.au/), even if you choose to
edit your documents using Microsoft Word. On the RUBRIC team we decided
to standardize on the OpenDocument format and use Writer for all our
work, and the staff there have taken to it quite well.

Our strategy is:

-   Support both Word and Writer.

-   Try as hard as we can to make interoperable templates and conversion
    software and macros and so on.

    But it's never 100%.

-   When interop fails <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> build the
    feature using OpenDocument and OpenOffice.org Writer. An example is
    cross referencing between documents,where we could not find an
    interoperable solution so we implemented for Writer. Word users miss
    out.

The result is that while you **can use Word** to work on content for
ICE, **Writer works better** when you're building books from your
content or wanting to use ICE to make changes to your document. Thus
it's easy for us to make a case for its use. We're not mandating
anything, or shoving anyone around, be we can show people very clearly
how a switch to OpenOffice.org will help them.

And we're hoping to start engaging with people in various fields in a
more concentrated way, working with them to make for better research
practice.

(I have some criticisms of OpenOffice.org and the Open Document Format
too, more coming.)

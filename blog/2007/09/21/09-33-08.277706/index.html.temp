The presentation is worth watching. My comment is that the science would not have to be open for the tools to be useful. </p><p>The <i>Data Curation Continuum</i> doesn't discuss this aspect of the practice of Science but it does look at data-flows. The authors note that there's a requirement that access is <b>controlled, not open</b> for a lot of researchers:</p><blockquote class="bq"><p>The work of investigators in the DART project has indicated that many researchers are extremely conservative when it comes to granting access to research data. This appears to be associated with increasing competition in attracting research funds and having articles accepted by high-value publications. The recent move in Australia towards assessment of institutional research performance based on quality metrics (the Research Quality Framework <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> DEST 2007) is only intensifying this. As a result, many researchers want tightly controlled access prior to publication. It is theoretically possible to provide the levels of access control demanded by researchers in a repository that also hosts open-access content, but separation of the two types of repositories may be a preferred solution. Post publication, there is some evidence that open access leads to increased accessibility and increased citation rates. This may encourage researchers to be less restrictive about access.</p><p><a href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/september07/treloar/09treloar.html">http://www.dlib.org/dlib/september07/treloar/09treloar.html</a> </p></blockquote><h1><a id="id4" name="id4"><!--id4--></a>1 Shared Notebook science</h1><p>I think that to cater to the access requirements noted by Andrew Treloar et al you might need a <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>Shared Notebook<span class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> approach as opposed to an Open Notebook approach. That is, the benefits of a unifying tools like Blogs and Wikis shared with colleagues but not open to all. ( I do realize that there's a bit of baggage that comes along for the ride if you substitute <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_source">Shared </a>for Open, but I think the term fits.)</p><p>In fact I've worked on a <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>Shared Notebook<span class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> project myself. <a href="http://rubric.edu.au/">RUBRIC</a>. RUBRIC used a shared space in which to work, which included a wiki, although our blogs were open-access. Read Kate Watson and Chelsea Harper's <a href="http://www.caudit.edu.au/educauseaustralasia07/authors_papers/Watson-112.pdf%20">paper</a> for more about how we got on. </p><p>So, some research needs to be kept under wraps, and some people are happier collaborating withing a trusted community. </p><p>But whether we're talking Open or Shared, there's a need to promote access and to communicate with peers. We need ways to do that on both sides of what Andrew Treloar and co. call <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>the curation boundary<span class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>. Which brings us to my second point. Making it easy to talk about data, right across the curation continuum.</p><h1><a id="id5" name="id5"><!--id5--></a>2 New tools needed</h1><p>Back to the Australian National Data Service, ANDS.</p><p>I think one contribution that USQ could make, in collaboration with someone (and I'm thinking of chemists because I have made contact with some) is to work out a generic service interface for making data easy to embed into document, from the ephemeral through to published works. Here's a workflow. I'll base it around <a href="http://ptsefton.com/blog/2007/06/22/cml_demo">my earlier example</a> of chemical markup language but it could apply to any kind of data, big or small.</p><ol class="lin" style="list-style: decimal;"><li><p>I make a new molecule. </p><p>Lets assume that it's a big one, so the Chemical Markup Language that describes it is a <b>big</b> lump of  XML.</p><p>(You have to suspend disbelief here. My first-year chemistry lecturer, Julia James suggested that chemistry might not be my vocation and pointed out that if I made up my mind quickly I could withdraw without penalty. I did.)</p></li><li><p>I commit all the data about my molecule to the ANDS data service, where I know it will be safe, and my colleagues can see it. This includes the CML but also observations I have made (I'm getting vague about the detail here, I know).</p></li><li><p>Now  I want to tell people about my work. Some of them might find the data because they are subscribed to a feed of some kind. Atom seems like an appropriate protocol given the subject matter, but RSS if you really must. But what about others who aren't using those tools or who want to know a bit more about the context of my work?</p></li><li><p>In addition to automated dissemination I want to record stuff in my notebook, which could be a wiki, or I may choose to blog it, maybe <a href="http://icecms.blogspot.com/2007/09/publish-to-blogger-from-ice-look-at-how.html">using ICE</a>. </p><p>I think what we need here is a way for me to chuck a link into my document (for small amounts of data I would simply paste the data in) and have helper software do the rest, making a print view of the data and embedding live visualization tools into the web view of the data.</p></li><li><p>Later, wehn I start a paper, and I can copy/paste bits from the blog and the Wiki into a document and have the ICE and the ANDS service look after the details.</p></li></ol><p>To support this I reckon we need a standard way to ask for <b>any data</b> in the <b>range of views</b> we want, with software to make it easy to write about it or call it up in a presentation. This is as necessary as bibliography management via a tool like <a href="http://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a>, isn't it?</p><p>The software service would need to do something like this:</p><ul class="lib"><li><p> Look at my data and work out that it's CML (or any one of hundreds of other formats).</p></li><li><p>Generate a 2D image for me to use in the print-view of my notes (may not be important for wikis and blogs but ICE makes PDF for everything and as you move towards publishing you want this view).</p></li><li><p>Generate the HTML code needed to embed a useful visualization in my web page.</p></li><li><p>Insert all the right stuff in the right places without me having to do anything, so I get a suitable live link from my notebook/blog to the data with a useful visualization</p></li></ul><p>ICE can already do some of this, and version 2, due in a couple of weeks will be a good platform for this kind of service.</p></div>

Back in April, I was on a panel at an
[AICTEC](http://www.aictec.edu.au/aictec/go/pid/1) forum on
[interoperability standards for
IT](http://www.aictec.edu.au/aictec/go/pid/570) in Education.

I'm always happy to contribute to the growth and vitality of Australia's
society. (Not too sure about the economy though. I think it might cause
global warming).

Anyway, at another meeting of a sub-group of AICTEC recently I was
pleased to see that there's a [summary of the
discussion](http://www.aictec.edu.au/aictec/go/pid/570%20). (Warning!

On **developing** content:

> Dr Sefton noted that universities work with their own courseware
> rather than collaborate and that portability in time and across campus
> is important, as is the cost of producing content. Research
> publications are usually in the form of PDFs, which are not
> re-useable. The building of better workflow processes is important.

On **discovering** content:

> Mr Sefton noted that most people access content through a Google
> search. Stable, long term infrastructure is required to enable
> re-discoverability. He noted that the first university with all course
> material online will have a huge marketing advantage.

Looks like I got across a number of my main points effectively enough
for someone to summarize them. And I didn't spill the beans about [USQ's
open courseware](http://ocw.edu.au/) even though I would have loved to
be able to talk about it in that context.

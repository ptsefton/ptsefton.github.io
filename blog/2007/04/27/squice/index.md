It's been pointed out by a few people that ICE is not a great name for a
computer program, cos It is hard to [find on
Google](http://www.google.com.au/search?q=ice&hl=en&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&hs=SzF&start=10&sa=N).
The ICE site is on page 2 for me. If I ask google for '[pages from
Australia](http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&hs=xea&q=ice&btnG=Search&meta=cr%3DcountryAU)'
ICE the [computer program](http://ice.usq.edu.au/) is number six. while
[*ice the
drug*](http://www.druginfo.adf.org.au/article.asp?ContentID=ice_crystal_methamphetamine_hy)
is number two.

But what about a new name that's better suited to people finding our
project via search engines?

Someone suggested [ICE-nine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice-nine) in
honour of [Kurt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Vonnegut).

I have been playing with ICE and USQ. How about Squice, which is an
anagram of USQ-ICE, which stands for University of Southern Queensland
Integrated Content Environment. Love the results Google gives for
[squice](http://www.google.com.au/search?q=squice&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a).
Mostly used as a name, but we also have:

Squice as a typo <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> I think he meant 'sauce', maybe 'spice'

:   Thats quite impressive, I don't think i can match that one. My last

:   The discussion is about toasted sandwiches <span
    class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> the 'brev' is a breville brand
    toasted sandwich maker.

Squice as a [variant of squeeze](http://www.driverheaven.net/444903-post1.html)

Something to do with engines?

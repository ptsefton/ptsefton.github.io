<h1>A first try of Zotero's Word integration for citations and bibliographies</h1>

<div><p class="P1"><a href="http://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a> is an open source bibliography management system - think EndNote embedded in your browser - that seems to be coming along very nicely even if there are <a href="http://netapps.muohio.edu/blogs/darcusb/darcusb/archives/2007/01/27/zotero-and-the-bazaar-what-zotero-should-learn-from-successful-open-source-projects">concerns </a>that it is not very open to external contributions. Oh, and the browser has to be Firefox.</p><p>It's important for the <a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/introduction/ice_rs.htm">ICE-RS</a> project that we have a good referencing application, and Zotero now looks pretty certain to be it. </p><p>I have been sort-of using Zotero for a while now to collect references, but its word processor integration only recently appeared and I only got around to looking at it today. </p><p>Here's a few notes on how Zotero works with Microsoft Word 2004 on the Mac. </p><ol class="lin" style="list-style: decimal;"><li><p>I downloaded the disk image, opened the template, and went  <code>File / Save as...</code> - Word helpfully offered to save in a templates directory so that worked fine <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> it's just not what you're meant to do. I should have put it in the startup folder for Word as described in the instructions.</p></li><li><p>There's a little toolbar with only three buttons. One inserts a citation, one inserts a bibliography and the other sets a single preference. That's abut the right number of buttons.</p></li><li><p>Citations get inserted like this: Sefton 2006() - think there must be a little formatting bug there.</p></li><li><p>My explorations didn't last long because it started complaining that it could not talk to Firefox, even after I restarted both Word and Firefox. I think it has problems if you try to include citations with incomplete data, or delete things from the database and leave them in the document.</p></li></ol><p>As far as I can tell almost all the work is done by Zotero. The Word macro uses AppleScript to make web (SOAP) calls to Firefox / Zotero behind the scenes. This looks very promising for ICE integration; should be easy to call Zotero with a list of citations and ask it to make a bibliography.</p><p>But, while I'm prepared to accept the limitations of new software, such as a small number citation styles for the Word plugin, <b>there's one thing I really don't like</b>. Zotero uses Word fields to store citation information. Those <b>fields do not work</b> when you open the document in OpenOffice.org. That's a complete show-stopper for us. Of course we could just make a new version of the macro that uses a more interoperable citation format, but I've attempted to <a href="http://forums.zotero.org/discussion/500/format-for-embedding-citations-in-word-processors/#Item_0">start a discussion on the Zotero forums:</a></p><blockquote class="bq"><p>My initial experiments indicate that citations embedded in Word using Fields are lost when the .doc file is opened in OOo. So, can we look at using a mechanism for carrying citation information that will be preserved. One approach would be to use bookmarks rather than fields. I have also considered looking for hyperlinks, matching those against URLs in Zotero and inserting appropriate citations.</p><p>What's the current thinking on this issue within the Zotero team?</p></blockquote><p>Zotero can recognize some kinds of metadata embedded in web pages and automatically import it. At the moment in doesn't recognize <a href="http://eprints.usq.edu.au/">USQ's Eprints</a>, even though it has Dublin Core metadata in the head element. It looks like adding support of our ePrints would be easy enough. There's an incomplete how-to on the site explaining how. We'll definitely look into teaching Zotero about ePrints and  the other repositories we deal with in RUBRIC.</p><h1><a id="id5" name="id5"><!--id5--></a></h1><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></div>

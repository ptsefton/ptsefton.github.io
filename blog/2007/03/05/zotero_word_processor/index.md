[Zotero](http://www.zotero.org/) is an open source bibliography
management system - think EndNote embedded in your browser - that seems
to be coming along very nicely even if there are
[concerns](http://netapps.muohio.edu/blogs/darcusb/darcusb/archives/2007/01/27/zotero-and-the-bazaar-what-zotero-should-learn-from-successful-open-source-projects)that
it is not very open to external contributions. Oh, and the browser has
to be Firefox.

It's important for the
[ICE-RS](http://ice.usq.edu.au/introduction/ice_rs.htm) project that we
have a good referencing application, and Zotero now looks pretty certain
to be it.

I have been sort-of using Zotero for a while now to collect references,
but its word processor integration only recently appeared and I only got
around to looking at it today.

Here's a few notes on how Zotero works with Microsoft Word 2004 on the
Mac.

1.  I downloaded the disk image, opened the template, and went
    `File / Save as...` - Word helpfully offered to save in a templates
    directory so that worked fine <span class="spCh spChx2013">â€“</span>
    it's just not what you're meant to do. I should have put it in the
    startup folder for Word as described in the instructions.

2.  There's a little toolbar with only three buttons. One inserts a
    citation, one inserts a bibliography and the other sets a single
    preference. That's abut the right number of buttons.

3.  Citations get inserted like this: Sefton 2006() - think there must
    be a little formatting bug there.

4.  My explorations didn't last long because it started complaining that
    it could not talk to Firefox, even after I restarted both Word and
    Firefox. I think it has problems if you try to include citations
    with incomplete data, or delete things from the database and leave
    them in the document.

As far as I can tell almost all the work is done by Zotero. The Word
macro uses AppleScript to make web (SOAP) calls to Firefox / Zotero
behind the scenes. This looks very promising for ICE integration; should
be easy to call Zotero with a list of citations and ask it to make a
bibliography.

But, while I'm prepared to accept the limitations of new software, such
as a small number citation styles for the Word plugin, **there's one
thing I really don't like**. Zotero uses Word fields to store citation
information. Those **fields do not work** when you open the document in
OpenOffice.org. That's a complete show-stopper for us. Of course we
could just make a new version of the macro that uses a more
interoperable citation format, but I've attempted to [start a discussion
on the Zotero
forums:](http://forums.zotero.org/discussion/500/format-for-embedding-citations-in-word-processors/#Item_0)

Zotero can recognize some kinds of metadata embedded in web pages and
automatically import it. At the moment in doesn't recognize [USQ's
Eprints](http://eprints.usq.edu.au/), even though it has Dublin Core
metadata in the head element. It looks like adding support of our
ePrints would be easy enough. There's an incomplete how-to on the site
explaining how. We'll definitely look into teaching Zotero about ePrints
and the other repositories we deal with in RUBRIC.

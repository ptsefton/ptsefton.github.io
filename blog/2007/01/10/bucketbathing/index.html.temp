<h1>How to wash yourself with less than 10 litres of water</h1>

<div><p class="P1">Murray Allen is a the founder of the USQ Community Environment Group. He's an environmentalist, an engineering student and a friend of the Sefton/Craig family.</p><p>We gave Murray &amp; his bicycle a lift to the wonderful Woodford Festival over the new year, in our environmentally sound vehicle, and he used the bike to visit ever y single amenities block to stick up two A4 pages about how to bathe in less than 10 lites of water.</p><p>Yesterday Murray got a call from Channel 9 in Sydney offering to fly him down so he could go on the Today show, today. Apparently somebody saw his posters and decided to make a spectacle of him.</p><p>Murray contacted me and asked me if I could get the bucket bathing stuff on the web so he could mention it on the show.  Since I happened to have a spare virtual server lying around I registered <a href="http://bucketbathing.com/">bucketbathing.com</a> and put Murray's handout on the site. </p><p>I recorded the show, in which Murray washes himself with a bucket and a sponge on national TV using our DVD recorder (he uses a sponge to wash himself I used a DVD recored to capture the show) . I had this idea that it would be simple to get the video and stick it up on youtube or something. Instead I encountered the wonderful world of .vob files. I had a MacBook and a dodgy Windows XP computer to hand, so I decided to have a race between them to see which one could get the video encoded first.</p><p>While I was doing that, I started writing this. Went to the Today show website and there's the video. You can't see it on a Mac, far as I can tell, and using Firefox on WinXP it tells you to first install IE 6 – only when you click on that link Microsoft tries to get you install IE 7. Whatever.</p><p>Anyway, if you have the right operating system and browser you have a 10% chance of seeing Murray!</p><p class="P2">Here's the <a href="http://ninemsn.video.msn.com/v/en-au/v.htm?f=39&amp;g=a39d9bb6-0901-4c29-8d80-c1c12d363102&amp;p=aunews_autoday&amp;t=m166&amp;mediaid=30245">video</a> link, I think. You'll either see Murray or this (notice the lower case 'f' in <i>free software</i>):</p><blockquote class="bq"><p>To use this product, you need to install free software</p><p>This product requires Microsoft© Internet Explorer 6, Microsoft© Media Player 10, and Macromedia Flash 6.

I keep forgetting to turn on the comments on this site and when I do I
forget to check them. You can always send me an email, like Jean-Claude
Bradley, who responds to [my post on Shared Notebook
Science](http://ptsefton.com/blog/2007/09/21/09-33-08.277706). I'm
reproducing his email here in full. More from me below.

Jean-Claude makes some good points here about the value of openness for
science, particularly <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span> it is really
really hard to get an author to admit they made a mistake and publish an
erratum or retract a paper once in print<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>.

In my previous post I cut some stuff about how I now favour working in
the open as much as possible, so I'll talk a bit about that now.

I mentioned the RUBRIC project, and the fact that we had a **shared but
not open** workspace. This presents us with a problem at the close of
the project. Participants in the project want a take-away version of the
shared space. But the shared space belongs to the trusted community, not
to their organizations or to the whole world. We're going to have to do
grab a snapshot of the Trac wiki, but we can't put it in a repository so
we will have to give everyone their own souvenir DVD.

(Some of the partner project managers on RUBRIC note that they liked the
shared space because it gave them a chance to ask dumb questions, and
put up drafts that they would not be happy to circulate more widely.
Maybe in future I just need to work with people who don't ask dumb
questions :-)

But seriously, this is an issue that needs to be addressed. There do
need to be places where people can draft things in-group, before moving
them out to the public. Even in open notebook science I'm sure most
people would not like to draft blog posts or wiki pages in public. The
challenge is to provide a shared workspace that's private but to move as
much as possible into the open as soon as possible, so at the end of a
project you don't have stuff hanging around that can't be archived
because it belongs to an ad-hoc project group which no longer exists.

I'm keen in future projects to try making all our 'notebooks' open as
far as possible, in the way we do in the ICE project, where our [Trac
site](http://ice.usq.edu.au/trac/roadmap) is open to read, or on the
AANRO evaluation project where there's a [project
blog](http://aanro-repo.blogspot.com/) and the final report will be
available under a Creative Commons license, but that doesn't mean that
you're going to be seeing my draft blog posts.

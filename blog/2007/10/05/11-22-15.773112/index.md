This is a frivolous post.

Yesterday I was working with a colleague on a poster presentation and I
used the word
[*nascent*](http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&hs=S1G&defl=en&q=define:NASCENT&sa=X&oi=glossary_definition&ct=title)*.*
He didn't know it, but he does now.

Later I [blogged over on the AANRO
blog](http://aanro-repo.blogspot.com/2007/10/affiliation-issue.html) and
used the word [*maven*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maven) to describe
Neil Godfrey and a couple of people in the office didn't know that word.

Strangely, the wikipedia page contains the word *nascent*.

Which reminded me of the time I was working as a tech writer. I put the
word *extensible* in my CV, but the agent I was working for said <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>that's not a proper word<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> and made me take it out. Subsequently I
went on to make my fortune doing
[XML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML).

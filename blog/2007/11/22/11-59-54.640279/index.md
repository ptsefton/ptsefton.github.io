Daniel de Byl and I will be running an[ICE workshop next Tuesday 27^th^
November 2007](http://www.apsr.edu.au/clevercollections/ice.htm). We're
staying on for the rest of the Clever Collections conference. Bring your
computer and we'll help you install ICE and get started.

The morning session will be highly technical <span
class="spCh spChx2013">â€“</span> I don't think anyone has signed up to
that so if you turn up you will get lots of attention. A there are still
places in the arvo for a general look at ICE. [Details and free
registration on the APSR
website](http://www.apsr.edu.au/clevercollections/ice.htm).

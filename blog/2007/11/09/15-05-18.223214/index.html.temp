Daniel de Byl has just posted a demo <a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/presentations/demos/ooo_to_wordpress.htm">using OpenOffice.org Writer to publish a nicely formatted blog post to WordPress</a>.</p><p>And today a <a href="http://ptsefton.wordpress.com/2007/11/09/ice-as-a-blog-editor/">supportive reply from PMR</a> to my post with a poem in it! Thing do indeed take time, I've been at this since 1996. I think we're getting there now, though. </p><p>I thought I'd try out the new ICE services using one of  Peter's posts and see what happens. I think that the ICE toolbar in Writer could help transcend the formatting problems with WordPress and we could look at doing interesting stuff like <a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/presentations/demos/try_ice_2x_for_wp.htm">CML integration</a>. </p><p>Here's his post (embedded in mine as a blockquote):</p><blockquote class="bq"><p><a href="http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/murrayrust/?p=797"><b>CrystalEye: using the harvester</b></a></p><p>Jim Downing has written a harvester for CrystalEye. I thought I would have a try and see if I could iterate through all the entries and extract the temperature of the experiment. This is where XML really starts to show its value over legacy formats. Jim<span class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>s iterator reads each entry and copies it to a file; I decided to read the entry as an XML document, search for the temperature using XQuery and announce it. It<span class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>s simple enough that I thought I could do it while watching Liverpool (I used to live on Merseyside). Unfortunately (or fortunately) the torrent of goals distracted me so it had to wait till today.</p><p>The temperature is described in the IUCr dictionary and held in CML as (example):</p><p>293.0</p><p>So this is trivially locatable by XQuery (with local-name() and @dictRef):</p>

We are converting it to RDF (and anyone interested can also do this) when it can be searched in a trivial amount of time and with much more complex questions. (Remember that CrystalEye was not originally designed as a public resource). Until then anyone who wishes to use CrystalEye a lot would do best to download the entries and build their own index.</p><p>[Note: I will continue to try to format the code - Wordpress makes it very difficult] </p></blockquote><p>Easy enough to do in ICE  apart from the slightly clunky way quoting works. We really need the ability to import HTML properly formatted as a blockquote. This would be very important for PMR, as he likes to quote big chunks. In HTML all you do is wrap <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> tags around the source for the quote and you're done. In ICE you have to imply the quote by marking the first paragraph as <code>bq1</code> style using our easy-to-click toolbar buttons, then indent the subsequent paragraphs appropriately with the indent button. We'll work on automating that but it's not that bad even now.</p><p>I considered using <a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2007/06/16/css-for-code-wrap-long-lines/">this tip</a> to change my CSS so that stuff in <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> tags wraps but on the test site I would have to pay to change the CSS. The theme I'm using uses this: <code>pre {overflow: auto;}</code> . PMR has used <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> inside a paragraph. Not sure what the solution would be there but maybe the same CSS would help.</p><p>You can see a <a href="http://ptsefton.wordpress.com/2007/11/09/ice-as-a-blog-editor/">draft version of this here post on my test blog</a>.</p><p>If you want to try this out and blog to WordPress from OpenOffice.org then see <a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/presentations/demos/try_ice_2x_for_wp.htm">the instructions</a>  that Daniel has put up on the ICE site and remember this is bleeding-edge alpha-quality Windows-only software at this stage. Remember also to actually read the instructions. The URL to use for WordPress is really important, for example.</p><p></p></div>

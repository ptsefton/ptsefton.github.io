Over the last couple of moths we've been breaking the ICE. That is, we
have been taking the big, complex [Integrated Content
Environment](http://ice.usq.edu.au/) and making it easier to use just
parts of it.

It's hard not to notice that the only place where full-blown ICE is used
much is at USQ, in that environment we have a hundred plus users, and
growing steadily, but the external teams we've tried to get using ICE
have all been slow to adopt it.

I have been thinking a lot about why this is.

-   It's too hard to install and set up, including the server-side
    components. (We're working on making it easier, bit by bit).

-   People don't perceive a need for HTML and PDF versions of their
    documents (although many do, and there are some [supporters out
    there](http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/2007/08/html-for-oa-journals-and-repositories.html)).

-   At USQ our academic staff are used to creating book-length
    distance-ready course content and we push hard for flexible
    delivery, so people do want HTML and PDF versions of content. Other
    places there's not the same culture.

There's lots more work to do, but we have made good progress on the
following:

1.  A server-based version of ICE <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span>
    nothing to install locally except a toolbar / template for your word
    processor. It will keep all your files under version control and let
    you build books, and courses using the same web interface as the
    current version.

2.  A few other ways to make good HTML from a desktop word processor
    without having ICE take over all your files and your life:

    1.  A command line version of ICE you could build into another
        application.

    2.  We are now testing a toolbar-button that will let you make good
        quality XHTML from your word processor and post it straight to
        an atompub enabled blogging site without having to use ICE. You
        still need to download ICE, but you don't have to run it as a
        webserver (Windows only so far <span
        class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> other platforms coming as Sam
        sorts out how). More on this in the very near future.

    3.  An ICE web conversion service that other applications will be
        able to use. See the [demos
        page](http://ice.usq.edu.au/presentations/demos/index.htm):

        -   We're working at USQ on building this into Moodle. Instead
            of delivering Word documents lecturers will be able to use
            the ICE template upload to Moodle and get HTML and PDF
            versions automatically. ([Peter Albion <span
            class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> are you
            listening](http://ptsefton.com/blog/2005/11/02/more_about_ice_and_why_xhtml_is_important)?
            Using Zotero you'll be able to write documents with proper
            reference management and publish them in both HTML and PDF
            at the click of a button. Isn't that better than dealing
            with DreamWeaver?)

        -   Other integrations with the OpenJournal system, Microsoft
            Content Management System, Sharepoint, and various
            repositories are also planned <span
            class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> bringing ICE to new
            audiences.

    4.  And following from (b) and (c) we'll be building a toolbar that
        can call a remote ICE web service - nothing to install but a
        word processor plugin.

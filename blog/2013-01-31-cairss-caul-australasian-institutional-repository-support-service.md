Title: CAIRSS – CAUL Australasian Institutional Repository Support Service
Wordpress_id: 1629
---

<article>
<section>
By Dr Peter Sefton (University of Western Sydney) with Ms Caroline Drury
(University of Southern Queensland).

On Wednesday 5^th^ Dec I (Peter) visited the Japanese Digital Repository
Federation at their invitation and expense, to talk about how our
respective repository communities are organised.  I’d like to thank the
DRF for this opportunity to make the brief trip to Tokyo. Caroline was
invited but was unable to make it. The DRF folks have put up a [summary
of the
meeting](http://drf.lib.hokudai.ac.jp/drf/index.php?DRF%20CAIRSS%20meeting),
in Japanese. Note that while my comments on that page are listed as
“CAIRSS” I was not representing CAIRSS (the CAUL (Council of Australian
University Librarians) Institutional Repository Support Service), I
attended as a member of the Australian/Australasian repository
community. I also attended the DRF international conference in 2009 on a
similar basis, when I did happen to be associated with CAIRSS, so the
organisers knew me. I did talk a fair bit about CAIRSS, in the context
of other projects in Australia.

Before I went I polled the CAIRSS-list to find out if there were any
questions people would like answered – more on that below.

First, a bit about me and repositories:

-   I was the technical lead for the Regional Universities Building
    Research Infrastructure Collaboratively
    ([RUBRIC](http://rubric.edu.au)) project which was hosted by the
    University of Southern Queensland (and the de-facto project manager
    for several months during the project establishment phase).

-   I led a small team at USQ subcontracting to the ARROW project during
    2008, providing technical support to ARROW, and repository services
    to small Higher Education institutions in Australia.

-   I worked on USQ’s successful bid to host the first CAIRSS repository
    support service in Australia and acted as a senior strategist for
    the service, for example working on guides such as the one on [how
    to get into Google Scholar et
    al](http://cairss.caul.edu.au/cairss/repository-manager-tools/getting-into-google-google-scholar-and-other-search-engines/),
    and negotiating major changes to repository infrastructure such as
    the closure of the Australian Digital Theses search service and its
    subsumption into the National Library of Australia’s Trove service.

-   I was **not** involved in running the second version of CAIRSS from
    2011-2012 but I have remained part of the repository community in
    Australia and attended the 2012 community day where I spoke about
    [trends in repository software in the context of organisational
    governance](http://ptsefton.com/2012/11/19/receding-repository-software.htm).

-   I am on the conference committee for the Open Repositories series of
    conferences (from 2011) – the [call for papers for the 2013
    conference is just out](http://or2013.net/content/call-proposals).

<section>
## The DRF

Shigeki SUGITA started off proceedings with a [presentation about the
activities of the Digital Repository
Federation](http://drf.lib.hokudai.ac.jp/drf/index.php?plugin=attach&pcmd=open&file=ActivitiesOfDigitalRepositoryFederation.pdf&refer=DRF%20CAIRSS%20meeting).

Perhaps the most striking thing from an Australasian point of view is a
staffing issue; talented repository managers are required by management
to rotate through a variety of library jobs meaning that there is
constant turnover and a lack of opportunity to specialise. There are
similar pressures at play in our libraries I guess, with a need to train
new repository staff, and significant turnover but not to the same
extent.

Japanese repositories are very much driven by an Open Access agenda,
which is quite different from the situation in Australia where two
different government measurement schemes collecting information about
publications and push repositories in another direction, more on that
below.

Another interesting dimension to the Japanese scene is that they have a
number of consortial-repositories where a number of institutions share a
repository. This is an idea that came up in Australia in the mid-to-late
00’s several times, but never got off the ground. It might be worth
revisiting some time both for institutional publications repositories

</section>
<section>
## The presentation

I presented from an earlier version of the ‘slides’ below – I have added
some notes from the discussion and clarifying material.

<section>
### CAIRSS background

<section typeof="http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide">
#### Parent projects

The Australian government made significant investments in institutional
repositories via programs such as:

-   [APSR](http://apsr.anu.edu.au/) Australian Partnership for
    Sustainable Repositories (ended 2008)

-   [ARROW](http://arrow.edu.au/) Australian Research Repositories
    Online to the World

-   [RUBRIC](http://rubric.edu.au/), Regional Universities Building
    Repository Infrastructure Collaboratively.

</section>
These projects and other investments in the repository world were via
these funding streams (for which the websites have disappeared):

-   ASHER2 – Australian Scheme for Higher Education Repositories
    [Sponsored the development of repositories in all Higher Education
    Institutions in Australia]

-   [SII3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_Infrastructure_Initiative)
    – Systemic Infrastructure Initiative [APSR, ARROW and RUBRIC]

-   [BAA4](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backing_Australia%27s_Ability) –
    Backing Australia's Ability

We talked in some detail about how these funding schemes have influenced
the establishment of repositories; while the initial driver for
Australian repositories was open access, the Excellence in Research for
Australia
([ERA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excellence_in_Research_for_Australia))
measurement exercise and its [failed
predecessor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Quality_Framework)
stalled the Open Access movement to some extent, by requiring
universities to collect non-open access materials in complicated ways.

<section typeof="http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide">
#### CAIRSS v1 2009-2011

Coming out of the investments outline above, CAIRSS was established on
 March 16, 2009:

> The first CAUL service was funded for two years, with the approval of
> Department of Innovation (DIISR), with monies remaining from the
> successful ARROW project, supplemented by CAUL member subscriptions.

</section>

</section>
<section typeof="http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide">
#### CAIRSS v1 staffing

This version of the CAIRSS service covered Australian universities, and
was staffed with:

-   A full time repository manager. (USQ)

-   A full time technical staff member. (USQ)

-   A full time copyright officer. (Swinburne)

-   A part-time strategic advisor and other senior support.

</section>
<section typeof="http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide">
#### CAIRSS v1 approach

The initial CAIRSS service included:

-   Annual meetings with both a general and technical strand.

-   Copyright workshops for private discussions of copyright issues.

-   Maintained ‘sandbox’ instances of repository software.

-   Creation and maintenance of web pages and guides on repository
    issues such as statistics, indexing and an extensive copyright
    guide.

-   Provided direct support for government reporting processes – chiefly
    the establishment of the Excellence in Research Australia (ERA)
    exercise.

<section>
## CAIRSS v2 2011-2012

<section typeof="http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide">
#### With added New Zealanders

The second version of CAIRSS was funded from member subscriptions and
expanded to include New Zealand:

> The second CAUL service is also funded for almost two years and
> incorporates many of New Zealand’s higher education institutions. With
> this expansion, CAIRSS now stands for the CAUL Australasian
> Institutional Repository Support Service.

</section>
<section typeof="http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide">
#### CAIRSS v2 Staffing

This version of CAIRSS had a reduced team in the central office at USQ.

-   One full time repository manager.

-   One half-time technical officer.

-   Part time senior manager.

-   Part time copyright person at Swinburne.

</section>
<section typeof="http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide">
#### CAIRSS v2 approach

The second CAIRSS service included:

-   Annual meetings with a general strand.

-   Discussion list for members only.

-   Copyright workshops for private discussions of copyright issues.

-   Maintenance of web pages on repository issues such as statistics
    etc.

-   Provided support for government reporting processes (ERA)

## Post CAIRSS: CRAC 2013-?

From 2013 CAIRSS will no longer exist – it is being replaced with a new
service know as CRAC.  I gather that the feeling of CAUL was that the
community is now mature enough to be self-sustaining.

#### New Open Access group: AOASG

There is a new Open Access group in Australia which is not part of the
CAUL/CAIRSS family.

From Danny Kingsley:

> The Australian Open Access Support Group (AOASG) was launched during
> Open Access Week in 2012. It is a consortium of six universities with
> open access policies  - QUT, ANU, Macquarie University, Newcastle
> University, Charles Sturt University and Victoria University. The
> group aims to provide support, lobbying and advocacy for open access
> in Australia. Membership will be extended to other research
> institutions and affiliates during 2013.

<section>
### General comments about the CAIRSS/CRAC community

<section>
#### Small task-force groups now self-organize

The repository community is well established and members of the
community run their own investigations into repository matters. These
range from asking questions on the list about repository practices, to
running formal surveys. An example from the broader CAUL community of
which CAIRSS is a part is the IR / Open Access Funding Survey by Danny
Kingsley and Vicki Picasso.

### Opportunities

<section typeof="http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide">
#### DRF collaboration?

From Caroline Drury:

> It would be interesting for CRAC to consider something similar to the
> DRF model  - eg at the beginning of each two year period, to meet and
> consider what projects could be done in the space, within Australia /
> NZ. Then perhaps a call could be put to institutions who could then
> (according to their strengths) be assigned to do that project in a
> collaborative model, using their own funds. I’m not sure if it would
> work here, given the big physical distances, but I think it's a good
> model in a scenario where there's limited funding. 

</section>
I’m sure CRAC will consider this.

<section typeof="http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide">
#### April event in Tasmania

An event is being organised in Tasmania in April around the following
themes. Regional participating would be most welcome.

From David Flanders at ANDS:

1.  linking research data and research publications

2.  re-architecting the repository (if we started now based on what we
    know).

3.  business metrics/analytics from scholarly systems

4.  research profiles and author identifiers

5.  emerging scholarly vocabularies, linkeddata & 

6.  scholarly search engines (beyond Google Scholar)

7.  APIs and bringing all these systems together via shared resources.

## Questions (with my notes)

Natasha Simons at Griffith University had three questions that provided
a great structure for the discussion part of the meeting. I tried to
take notes (included below) as well as talk.

## Next steps

Once again, thanks to the DRF for having me – I am following up with
CAUL on how we might be able to collaborate further. Now that we are in
the CRAC era, Caroline’s suggestion of having a ‘call for projects’ that
then get implemented at the member institutions sounds like it might be
a way forward, and an ongoing relationship with the DRF (and the UK RSP)
would be helpful, as they’ve been down this road before.

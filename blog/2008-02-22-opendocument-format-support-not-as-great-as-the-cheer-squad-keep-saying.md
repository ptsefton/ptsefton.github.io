I know I've[said this
before](http://ptsefton.com/blog/2007/06/05/science_and_nature/), but I
can't help it. Just because an application has 'Save as OpenDocument'
feature that does not mean it has **useful** OpenDocument support.

Benjamin Horst at SolidOffice[points
to](http://www.solidoffice.com/archives/719) [Dispelling Myths around
ODF](http://blogs.sun.com/dancer/entry/dispelling_myths_around_odf) (I
don't think all the myths really are myths (and why do people keep
saying that ODF uses SVG? I reckon that's [a
myth](http://idippedut.dk/post/2008/01/Embrace-and-extend---SVG-revisited.aspx).)
but I don't have time to argue) I will confine myself to a comment on
this bit. Benjamin writes:

I can't comment on all of those, or the [full list on
Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument_software#Word_processors)
but I do know these three things.

1.  OpenOffice.org and StarOffice share a codebase <span
    class="spCh spChx2013">â€“</span> they're really variants on the same
    application, while IBM Lotus Symphony also uses a lot of the same
    code, with the [menus scrambled and no HTML
    export](http://ptsefton.com/2008/01/25/ibm-lotus-symphony-word-processor-does-not-have-broken-html-export-like-all-the-others.htm).
    At least they're likely to interoperate.

2.  Google Docs [still has pretty
    useless](http://ptsefton.com/blog/2006/08/22/writely_again) ODT
    support. I just did another quick test and it still (a) produces
    awful HTML and (b) loses styles when you import ODT and (c) can't
    export native Google Docs without significant weirdness.

3.  The current shipping version of KOffice uses ODT in such a different
    way to OpenOffice.org that interoperability doesn't work for
    anything but straight-ahead text. KOffice doesn't have any
    implementation of list styles for example. The new version might be
    better but I have not figured out how to get a copy to try out
    without building it from source.

I wonder if anyone has looked properly at ODF interop, with a matrix of
supported features and notes on how various import/export pairs work?
From what I have seen, it would not be a pretty picture.

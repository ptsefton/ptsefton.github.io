Anticipated FAQ:

-   **What?** eResearch Support Manager - more or less the same gig as
    I've had at [UWS](http://uws.edu.au), in a tech-focussed uni with a
    bigger team, dedicated
    [visualisation](http://www.uts.edu.au/future-students/design-architecture-and-building/facilities/research-facilities/data-arena-prototype#the-data-arena)
    service and [HPC](https://eresearch.uts.edu.au/hpc/) staff, an
    actual budget and mostly within a few city blocks.

-   **Why [UTS?](http://uts.edu.au)** A few reasons.

    -   There was a job going, I thought I'd see if they liked me. They
        did. I already knew some of the eResearch team there. I'm
        confident we will be good together.

    -   It's a continuing position, rather than the five-year,
        more-than-half-over contract I was on, not that I'm planning to
        settle down for the rest of my working life as an eResearch
        manager or anything.

    -   The physical concentration should be conducive to Research
        Bazaar [\#resbaz](http://resbaz.tumblr.com/about) activities
        such as [Hacky
        Hour](http://resbaz.tumblr.com/post/74791203771/join-us-for-hacky-hour).

-   **But what about the travel!!!!?** It will be 90 minutes laptop time
    each way on a comfy, reasonably cheap and fairly reliable train
    service with almost total mobile internet coverage, with a few
    hundred metres walking on either end. That's a change from 35-90
    minutes each way depending on what campus(es) I was heading for that
    day and the mode of transport, which unfortunately was mostly motor
    vehicle. I do *not* like adding yet another car to Sydney's M4, M7
    or M5, despite what I said in my UWS staff
    [snapshot](http://uws.edu.au/auws/arounduws_home_page/auws_archives/2014/july/staff_snapshot_peter_sefton).
    I think I'll be fine with the train. If not, oops. Anyway, there are
    inner-Sydney family members and mates I'll see more of if only for
    [lunch](https://plus.google.com/111155206947420479345/about?gl=au&hl=en).

    When the internets stop working the view is at its best. OK, apart
    from the tunnel and the cuttings.

-   **What's the dirt on UWS?** It's not about UWS, I've had a great
    time there, learned how to be an eResearch manager, worked on some
    exciting [projects](http://uws.edu.au/eresearch/home/projects), made
    some friends, and I'll be leaving behind an established, experienced
    eResearch team to continue the work. I'm sorry to be going. I'd work
    there again.

-   **Why did you use this mode of announcement?** I was [inspired

    few weeks a go.

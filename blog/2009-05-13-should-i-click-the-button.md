Last year [I wished you all a Happy Open Access
day](http://ptsefton.com/2008/10/16/happy-open-access-day.htm) and
wondered if I should accept an invitation to write an article for a
toll-access publication. The few comments I got on the blog and in
person basically said go ahead and get my stuff out there, which I did,
now all I have to do is wait. And wait. You can read the [blog post
about
OAI-ORE](http://ptsefton.com/2008/10/14/what-the-oai-ore-protocol-can-do-for-you.htm)
that inspired the offer, though.

This year I was asked to write an article for another publisher. The
paper has been written and submitted and accepted. As they charmingly
put it:

> A final disposition of "Accept" has been registered for the
> above-mentioned manuscript.

I have been invited to complete a few administrative tasks, including
agreeing to the Journal Publishing Agreement. Basically this gives the
publisher my copyright. I get the right to use my version for scholarly
purposes, which means that I can post it here and stick it in
[ePrints](http://eprints.usq.edu.au/) at USQ and put it in a thesis, and
even turn it into a book if I follow some conditions. Fair enough, I
knew what I was getting into when I agreed to write the thing. I have to
do it Elsevier's way to get the prestige that goes with their brand.

Hang on! Elsevier?

The same [Elsevier which published fake
journals](http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/2009/05/elsevier-confirms-6-fake-journals-more.html)?

Will they use my, sorry their, paper to sell drugs? Or Microsoft Word?

I'm inclined to go ahead and click the button, because this is a chance
for me to go through the process and see what it's like. See how much
value the editors add. See what the final product looks like. Use what I
learn to work on [Journal
2.0](http://del.icio.us/ptsefton/ptsefton+journal2.0).

I don't expect that toll-access journals are going to be at all relevant
to the kind of work I do before too long, so this will be something to
tell the grandkids about, how I wrote something for nothing and then
gave the exploitation rights to a large corporation.

On the other hand, maybe I should stage a sit-in.

So, should I or should I not click the button that says Accept
Agreement? Comments open below.

They do have a detailed explanation about [why they need exclusive
rights](http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/authorsview.authors/copyright#exclusive)
which is all about how people trust them. Right.

I think that the model where academia pays multiple times for their own
work is so patently absurd, and the [alternatives are working so
well](http://pkp.sfu.ca/) that this way of doing business will die.

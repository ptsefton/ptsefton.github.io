## Pitching for the DevCSI Developer Challenge at Open Repositories 11

On the first day of pre-conference meetings at Open Repositories 2011 we
started promoting the DevCSI Developer Challenge. We visited all of the
meetings we could and encouraged people, to:
-   if at all possible, enter
-   come along to the Developer Lounge during the conference and at the
    final 'Show and Tell Session' on Thursday afternoon to see 'the
    future of repostiories'
-   encourage any of their colleagues who might have good ideas and some
    development skills to step up.

Each of the meetings had a different mood. The [Fedora Commons
committers](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/FCREPO/June+6th+2011%2C+OR11+Committer+Meeting "June 6th 2011, OR11 Committer Meeting")
were committed to solving fundamental architectural questions around
authentication, authorisation, modularity and so on. The [Hydra
Partners](http://sites.tdl.org/openrepositories/or11preconference/#monday "Monday's Pre Conference Sessions at OR11")
were heads-down bringing together threads of work that have been going
on all over the world on a major application. The [Curate
Camp](http://curatecamp.org/ "Curate Camp"), was set up as a kind of
unconference where delegates had to choose/vote from a [list of
topics](http://wiki.curatecamp.org/index.php/CURATEcamp_OR11_Ideas "CURATEcamp OR11 Ideas")
(e.g. community consensus on the tools, specifications, and
microservices that are most needed; use cases for those tools, specs,
and services; and interoperability among tools and repositories/digital
asset management systems) in the area of curation, either presented
prior to the meeting or during and discuss them for 30 minutes. If
discussions were deemed valuable enough to continue, they did, if not,
they moved on to the next one.

And the [DSpace
group](https://wiki.durhttps://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DevMtg+2011-06-06+-+OR11+Meetingspace.org/display/FCREPO/June+6th+2011%2C+OR11+Committer+Meeting "Developers Meeting before OR11 on Mon, June 6, 2011")
had started their session with some blue-sky dreaming. They compiled a
list of points on “What's the modern Repo?”. This is pretty close to our
developer challenge theme of “The Future of Repositories”. Below, see a
transcript of a whiteboard, taken from an [EtherPad
document](http://piratepad.net/or11dspacemeeting) from the DSpace
meeting that we were not attending, via Tim Donohue. Might lack a little
context, but worth glancing through for inspiration.

There are some key words and phrases here we might have heard 5 years
ago at the first [OR in
Sydney](http://www.apsr.edu.au/Open_Repositories_2006/ "Australian Partnership for Sustainable Repositories"),
such as “submission should be much much easier” or “preservation”. But
back then we would not have been hearing about
[Dropbox](http://dropbox.com), the beautifully simple cloud-based file
replication system or the SWORD deposit protocol because they were not
invented yet and nobody knew we wanted them until developers made them.

One thing on the list is “new name”.  A potential entry in could be
built around that. Think of a new name instead of repository and show
something that demonstrates what it would look like.

Or could you re-imagine the repository as set of small pieces that
all “do one thing, [&] do it well”? Get one piece working, and tell us
about the rest.

> **“What’s the modern repo?” Brainstorm**

> Link (including
> photo: https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/Brainstorming+Activity)

> - not just research: photos, music, data, etc

> -- More different kinds of content and metadata

> - research management systems

> -- CRIS moves the repository to the back-end. As CRIS will be the
> front end

> -- In edinburgh, PURE is being used with the LNI to ingest

> - simple (visual?) import -- think dropbox?

> - DepositMO

> - SWORD / SWORD2

> - Scott: submission should be much much easier.

> - Bram: ScribD also had very easy upload, but poor in metadata. Nice 
> feature in embedding lists & collections in other applications

> - automated metadata capture

> - content easy to use / reuse

> - CRUD

> - branding / theming

> - customisations (metadata and metadata structure)

> - storage system integrations

> - flexible content workflows

> - versioning / relationships

> - flexible authorisation

> - give control to user communities (branding, etc)

> - complex objects (representation of), human- and machine-readable

> - scientific data sets

> - reporting

> - content reuse ("open" data)

> - eg. embed in dept website

> - search (easy)

> - faceting / filtering

> - statistics: regular reports to item authors (like Digital Commons),
> plus usage/admin reporting

> - bot filtering

> - getting stuff out

> - disciplinary aggregation

> - creating adhoc "sets" of content

> - (this made me think of http://www.apsr.edu.au/orca/ - Kim)

> - shareable metadata

> - different metadata "views"

> - shared version vs local use

> - new name: just "repository" or "storage"?

> - preservation

> - identifiers / persistance (flexible, granular, parts of items,
> people, collections)

> - the perils of handles...

> - DOIs vs Handles

> - Truly \*external\* IDs

> - access / privacy

> - "repository / DAM system that can display stuff vs. CMS that can do
> DAM"

> - do one thing, do it well

> - flexible metadata schema

> - dissemination

> - make data usable http://piratepad.net/or11dspacemeeting

It seems to me that there is a bit of buzz at the moment around the need
for a desktop eResearch tool that can organize your stuff locally and
push it up to a managed store.

In no particular order.

There was a conversation between a couple of Sydneysiders on Twitter on
the \#eresearch channel:

Subsequently, Rowan Brownlee (usyd\_dpa) has [started a conversation on
the ANDS
group](http://groups.google.com.au/group/ands-general/browse_thread/thread/660ad62751a8dca1?hl=en-GB)
asking about tools for researchers to organize their stuff, label it
using taxonomies and share it. So far no response to that. I would have
expected someone to mention [Field
Helper](http://acl.arts.usyd.edu.au/fieldhelper/), which is from Sydney.

> Field Helper is a desktop application that enables you to quickly view
> and categorise groups of related digital files and then submit the
> resulting package to a repository for long term preservation and
> access. Digital repositories require a submission to be formated in a
> specific way and be described according to a standard meta data

> containing compressed versions of your files along with a METS
> (Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard) file which contains a
> detailed description of each file and its relationship to other files
> in the submission. METS is a standard that works with most
> repositories and - where required - can be easily translated into a
> form that non METS compliant repositories can work with.

I have looked at Field Helper in the past <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> I don't think that the metadata tagging
is going to scale very well and the system for mapping tags onto formal
metadata seems a bit clumsy but it does some of what I think Rowan is
asking for.

Also in the last few days, Les Carr mourns another lost disk drive and
other lost week of work, and tells us [why he needs trusted
storage](http://groups.google.com.au/group/ands-general/browse_thread/thread/660ad62751a8dca1?hl=en-GB).
He says:

> So an intelligent store should help me understand what I have - a bit
> like the way that user tools like iPhoto help you understand and
> organise thousands of images. It should be possible to get a highly
> distilled overview/representation/summary/visualisation of all my

Yes <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> I can see where Les is going
<span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> at least I think he's hinting at
ePrints on the desktop.

I [made the same sort of
mixup](http://ptsefton.com/2008/12/02/embargoes-on-bits-of-theses-skating-on-thin-ice.htm)
in my mind back in December:

> Thinking about this led me to the idea of putting something like The

And finally, we have Dorothea Salo with this [one
liner](http://cavlec.yarinareth.net/2009/03/02/violently-in-agreement/).
There are a lot of other lines you can read as well in her response to
this piece at [Library Journal dot
com](http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6639327.html).

> Data curation and IR population need to be reframed as <span
> class="Emphasis">collection-development challenges</span>.

Now, maybe Rowan's plea to the ANDS group will turn up an application
that does what we want, but I think we might have to take up the
*collection-development-challenge*.

Dorothea says:

> Bluntly, DSpace and EPrints are completely inadequate to meet the
> data-curation challenges you [Clifford Lynch] outline; and Fedora can
> mostly do the job, but only with major hacking. This is unacceptable.
> How can we offer data services when we don<span

Here at the Australian Digital Futures Institute
([ADFI](http://www.usq.edu.au/adfi)) we're up for a bit of 'major
hacking', although we find it soothes our management team to call it
'software development'. That's why we pretend that I'm the manager of
the Software Development Research and Development team, not just the one
with the biggest mouth in a feral mob of hackers.

At the moment we are working with [Chris
Lee](http://www.usq.edu.au/users/leec/)'s [Public Memory Research
Centre](http://www.publicmemory.org/) on a repository for the
humanities. Ultimately it will have creative arts content and research
materials <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> we're starting with a
military history project run by [Leonie
Jones](http://apps.usq.edu.au/usqwebsite/aspnet/staffsearch/default.aspx?action=stafflookup).

Leonie has been doing exactly what Rowan describes: <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>They each manage binary and text content
on their desktops or departmental fileservers using spreadsheets and/or
sql databases<span class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>. Leonie has
spreadsheets.

We are *considering* trying the following based on our Fedora-based
lightweight repository solution known as [The
Fascinator](http://ice.usq.edu.au/projects/fascinator/trac).

We'll start with a local installation of The Fascinator <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> that puts Fedora 3 and Apache Solr on
your desktop. Don't worry, we have a simple installer. It's all Java, so
it might be painful for the programmers at times but it should install
pretty much anywhere.

Then we will add a file-system indexer for The Fascinator <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> pretty much like what Picasa does, it
will index *all* of your stuff. It will grab whatever metadata it can,
including properties from office documents, EXIF metadata and tags from
images . We will also treat the file system as a source of metadata so
you will be able to explore using metadata facets and file system facets
using the same interface. This should be a very straightforward addition
to the existing software, it's just a matter of bolting together some
standard software libraries.

<span

Next comes the taxonomy/tagging bit: we need a way to import tag-sets
and taxonomies that you might want to apply to your content and then let
you tag it. I think it will be important to support both formal metadata
and informal tagging. For example, you might want to set up your own tag
hierarchy with home/work at the root, and with work broken down into
teaching/research and research broken up by project.

I think the tag hierarchy in digiKam is a good start. Here's a
screenshot showing my home-grown tag set applied to my own photos. I
think a new tool should allow both ad hoc DIY sets and more formal
ontologies.

So we can add a new action for the user:

<a name="Object2"></a>![Object2](/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/5875c3e5.gif)

There are a couple of things we'd like to look at here:

1.  There is often metadata inherent in the file system. I can point to
    my Music folder and say 'that's all owned by me'.

2.  There are relationships between files; Leonie has video transcripts
    with time-codes. If we plug in a smart indexer then we should be
    able to get our text index to let you find words and jump to the
    right part of the video. So, we need plugins <span
    class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> which may often have to be one-offs.
    Ben O'Steen has a great blog post where he [talks us through one
    such curation
    exercise](http://oxfordrepo.blogspot.com/2008/10/modelling-and-storing-phonetics.html).

3.  Which bits of metadata should be written back into the files? For my
    own images I [have been adamant that I want metadata written back
    into the
    files](http://ptsefton.com/2008/04/24/some-thoughts-on-vendor-lock-in-from-the-domestic-to-the-institutional-is-apple-mac-os-x-evil.htm),
    but what if different members of the family wanted to classify
    things in different ways? Stand-offish metadata may be better if we
    can build trusted systems that know how to keep things linked up.

4.  Add 'playlists' to group content. This is a actually just like what
    you do in content packaging, for example the organizer in an IMS
    content package.

At this point in the story we can index everything, label it, and
explore it. Next step would be replicating it up into a cloud of
repository services. I can imagine a couple of use cases here:

-   Everything with the tag `work` is to be backed up to the university
    system. This would be a mirror of what's on my desk and by default
    only accessible to me. There's going to be a lot of data and we
    can't leave it all in our houses offices and labs.

-   Everything under `/Music` is to be backed up to a private data store
    <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> maybe via another copy of The
    Fascinator running at home, or even a copy in the cloud somewhere.

-   Everything tagged with ePrints goes to you-know-where (Hi Les).

-   Everything tagged with `thesis` is to be replicated to the
    departmental thesis repository where my supervisor will be able to
    see it as well.

-   Everything tagged with PMRC goes to the centre's repository where
    the repository's curator can, you know, curate it. This could be as
    simple as adding a tag `public`, that means that it will then be
    disseminated to the public institutional repository.

To get this kind of data federation going I'd look at Atom Archive for
the feed mechanism (that's going to kill off OAI-PMH, right?) with
OAI-ORE to package the metadata we've added with the source-objects.

<span
style="display: block"><a name="Object3"></a>![Object3](/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/m68b864bb.gif)</span>

One feature of this setup which might not be immediately obvious is
having the same kind of repository interface on the desk as you would
have in a web based repository. The idea is to encourage people to see
their research data as 'in the repository' from the moment of creation
and to be able to take control over how their stuff is disseminated.
This is a like the ICE approach of previewing early and often so that
people get used to seeing their documents both in paper format and web
format.

There are some free desktop applications that do *some* of what I'm
talking about here. Duncan Dickinson is collecting a list of them. They
include the aforementioned [Field
Helper](http://acl.arts.usyd.edu.au/fieldhelper/) and things like
[Mendeley](http://www.mendeley.com/) which manages research papers, but
not, it seems research data.

And lets be clear here. We have never, ever been under the illusion that
if we build it they will come, not with our ePrints system, not with
[ICE](http://ice.usq.edu.au/), not with any system. We know that if we
decide to build then we will have to build something that either the
users need, or didn't know they needed. In this case I am betting the
first selling point is the backup feature but funder requirements to
place data in repositories may be a motivator in the distant future.

Should we try building this thing? It would only take a fe w weeks to
prototype.

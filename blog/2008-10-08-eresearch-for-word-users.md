I'm back in Toowoomba after a week away at the [eResearch Australasia
2008 conference in Melbourne](http://www.eresearch.edu.au/). As usual I
didn't live-blog any of it but I will try to post on my thoughts from
the conference over the next week or so. Not sure how I go with that as
I have stuff to prepare for the ARROW event in Brisbane next week, where
I'm [looking at the new OAI-ORE
standard](http://arrow.edu.au/news/abstracts.php#What) and for [Open
Standards 08 in
Sydney](http://www.open-standards.com/sched-at-a-glance.html) where I'm
talking about standards in the ICE context.

The peer-reviewed paper from era08 is[now available in the UQ
repository](http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:155359) <span
class="spCh spChx2013">â€“</span> it's just a PDF at present, as that's
the way research is typically published. Very Web 0.5.

The Web 1.0 version, i.e. one that is actually in HTML will be out soon,
as we are in the process of finalizing an ICE to ePrints hook-up at USQ.
I'm aiming to post the paper, the poster and the presentation that I
gave at the humanities workshop in Friday as an HTML package, with PDF
versions as well.

I [posted my
poster](http://ptsefton.com/2008/09/30/ice-eresearch-for-word-users.htm)
here last week.

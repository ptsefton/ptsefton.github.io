Susan Gibbons decried it in 2006 with regard to the Rochester
repository. In her slide <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>early
misunderstandings<span class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>:

> Early Misunderstandings
>
> -   Faculty see need for repository
>
> -   Faculty see value in repository
>
> -   Self-archiving is a practical expectation
>
> -   Technology is the difficult part
>
> ****

> Build it and they will come!

Sounds like a prescient bullet point summary of a cavlec post or two.

I remember Susan's
[talk](http://www.apsr.edu.au/presentations/successful.html) as
inspiring. They built it. Users didn't come. They responded by doing
anthropology on the users to find out what they wanted, in order to work
out what to build next time, and followed up with projects like the one
I [mentioned here](http://ptsefton.com/blog/2006/10/19/rochester_grant/)
where I gave some advice along with Jim Downing, whose desk I'm sitting
at right now in Cambridge.

(The Rochester work is cited in Roach Motel I believe.)

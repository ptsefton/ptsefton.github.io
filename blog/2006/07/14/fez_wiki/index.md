On July 12<span class="T1">th</span> Cameron Loudon and I visited
Belinda Weaver and Christiaan Kortekaas of the APSR project to talk to
them about [Fez](http://sourceforge.net/projects/fez), which is software
for making an Institutional Repository.

Fez has impressed at least one of the RUBRIC project managers enough to
warrant more detailed evaluation than the simple tyre-kicking we have
given it so far. But being a new, largely untested open source product
there are a lot of questions we need to ask, about technical matters,
bugs, and project governance.

Actually a lot a the questions are similar to those you need to ask of a
commercial vendor. When is feature X coming? What's in version Y?

One of the joys of working with an open source project is, well,
openness. Fez has a
[wiki](http://dev-repo.library.uq.edu.au/wiki/index.php/Main_Page), and
the whole world is invited to go and help fill out their FAQ.

I just went added not only a question (*What skill-set would I need to
implement Fez?*) but an answer I think is right(ish). [Caroline
Ayers](http://sophiaca.wordpress.com/) wrote the answer.

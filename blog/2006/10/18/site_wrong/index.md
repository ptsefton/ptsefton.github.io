My long suffering partner pointed out this morning that this site was
not looking that great on Internet Explorer  on the Windows box at home,
at least. She must have been making her annual visit. The text of a page
would show below the pink-and-yella  'inverted L'.  I said I kind of
knew, and I guessed it wasn't very good that I had not fixed it yet. She
agreed:

I worked out that it was probably the Google ads causing the problem.
But fixing it properly involves dealing with that terribly hard CSS
stuff. I don't want to go through all that again – [as described in one
of my first posts on this
site](http://ptsefton.com/blog/2004/05/17/csssux).

So I just made the ads smaller and that seemed to fix it. Now I'll make
even less money that I do now.

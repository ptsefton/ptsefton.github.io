In a [recent
rant](http://ptsefton.com/blog/2006/09/23/publish_everywhere) I wrote
about the ongoing problems with OpenOffice.org writer's handling of
tables and lists.

Since then I've dicovered the GullFOSS blog, via [Simon
Phipps](http://blogs.sun.com/webmink/), which is run by the
OpenOffice.org development team. And guess what? The two things I was
ranting about, tables and lists are on the list of stuff they're doing.

> Word Import Filter: Import of Tables
>
> Core Development: Design of Table Model supporting all ODF tables and
> Word tables
>
> MS Interoperability: Design changes for Numbering/Outlines
>

Â I feel a bit better now. And I'm liking NeoOffice running on a (black)
MacBook now that I have [fixed up a
way](http://ptsefton.com/blog/2006/09/22/neo-office-keys) to apply
[ICE](http://ice.usq.edu.au/) styles from the keyboard.

new \$13.18 (that's Australian dollars) plugin for OpenOffice.org and
StarOffice that purports to be a weblog editor.

I have tried it out but I can't recommend it.

I normally wouldn't buy a bit of software that I don't need, with no
free trial, but I just had to try it, 'cos I've been wanting to see the
issue of HTML export from OpenOffice.org addressed properly. I don't
expect this to actually work for anything except plain paragraphs, for
reasons [discussed here](http://del.icio.us/ptsefton/ptsefton+wpinterop)
many times before but I thought I should prove the point. Except that I
can't prove it 'cos I can't post with it to see how it works.

First up, I went and set up an account at
[http://ptsefton.wordpress.com](http://ptsefton.wordpress.com/). That
was easy.

Buying the software from Sun was a bit harder – I accidentally clicked
something that said 'check' beneath my credit card details – turned out
that meant I wanted to pay by cheque – only I didn't and there was no
way to uncheck all the payment options I didn't want, so I ended up with
an extra order I don't intend to pay for.

It's not supposed to work on Mac OS X in NeoOffice but it installs OK
and it made a connection to ptsefton.wordpress.com  once I realised that
I had to go into the settings in NeoOffice and tell it not to use a web
proxy (choose None rather than System).

I wrote some text.

Then I looked around for preview button to see what the HTML was going
to be like. Nope.

Tried to publish and discovered that it won't connect to Wordpress.com
any more. I can get a sort-of connection to the server, it seems, by
turning on and off the proxy but I can't post. Half an hour of that was
enough, so I headed off to Blogger to try my luck with an account there.
That wouldn't work either, same complaint from the software:

Then I tried:

1.  Connecting to the university network via VPN and configuring a proxy
    server in NeoOffice.

2.  Changing my Wordpress password.

3.  The X11 version of OpenOffice.org on the Mac (also not supposed to
    work and I can confirm that it doesn't. It won't install properly.).

4.  The Windows version of OpenOffice.org on the PC at home (2.0.4 on XP
    SP2) which is supposed to work. Same symptoms as NeoOffice, mostly,
    only worse.

5.  All of the above with the Bogger account.

No luck.

And the site says:

> There is no product support for Sun Weblog Publisher. If you have
> feedback about the product you can email them to
> Weblog-Publisher-feedback@sun.com

I'll do that.

<h1>New Weblog plugin for OpenOffice.org Writer: Won't connect to wordpress.com</h1>

<div><p class="P1">Simon Phipps <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/webmink/entry/birthday_presents">writes</a> about a new $13.18 (that's Australian dollars) plugin for OpenOffice.org and StarOffice that purports to be a weblog editor. </p><blockquote class="bq"><p>In our first venture to fund Sun's OpenOffice.org developers through an add-on product, we've released Sun Weblog Publisher, a plug-in for OpenOffice.org or StarOffice 8 that turns it into a full-featured blog editor. At only $9.95 it's exceptional value, and it directly supports our efforts to keep OpenOffice.org development rolling.</p><p><a href="http://blogs.sun.com/webmink/entry/birthday_presents">http://blogs.sun.com/webmink/entry/birthday_presents</a> </p></blockquote><p>I have tried it out but I can't recommend it.</p><p>I normally wouldn't buy a bit of software that I don't need, with no free trial, but I just had to try it, 'cos I've been wanting to see the issue of HTML export from OpenOffice.org addressed properly. I don't expect this to actually work for anything except plain paragraphs, for reasons <a href="http://del.icio.us/ptsefton/ptsefton+wpinterop">discussed here</a> many times before but I thought I should prove the point. Except that I can't prove it 'cos I can't post with it to see how it works.</p><p>First up, I went and set up an account at <a href="http://ptsefton.wordpress.com/">http://ptsefton.wordpress.com</a>. That was easy. </p><p>Buying the software from Sun was a bit harder – I accidentally clicked something that said 'check' beneath my credit card details – turned out that meant I wanted to pay by cheque – only I didn't and there was no way to uncheck all the payment options I didn't want, so I ended up with an extra order I don't intend to pay for.</p><p>It's not supposed to work on Mac OS X in NeoOffice but it installs OK and it made a connection to ptsefton.wordpress.com  once I realised that I had to go into the settings in NeoOffice and tell it not to use a web proxy (choose None rather than System).</p><p>I wrote some text.</p><p>Then I looked around for preview button to see what the HTML was going to be like. Nope. </p><p>Tried to publish and discovered that it won't connect to Wordpress.com any more. I can get a sort-of connection to the server, it seems, by turning on and off the proxy but I can't post. Half an hour of that was enough, so I headed off to Blogger to try my luck with an account there. That wouldn't work either, same complaint from the software:</p><p><a id="graphics1" name="graphics1"></a><img alt="graphics1" class="fr1" height="113" src="/blog/2006/10/20/sun-weblog/1.png" width="461"/></p><p>Then I tried:</p><ol class="lin" style="list-style: decimal;"><li><p>Connecting to the university network via VPN and configuring a proxy server in NeoOffice.</p></li><li><p>Changing my Wordpress password.</p></li><li><p>The X11 version of OpenOffice.org on the Mac (also not supposed to work and I can confirm that it doesn't. It won't install properly.).</p></li><li><p>The Windows version of OpenOffice.org on the PC at home (2.0.4 on XP SP2) which is supposed to work. Same symptoms as NeoOffice, mostly, only worse. </p></li><li><p>All of the above with the Bogger account.</p></li></ol><p>No luck.</p><p>And the site says:</p><blockquote class="bq"><p>There is no product support for Sun Weblog Publisher. If you have feedback about the product you can email them to Weblog-Publisher-feedback@sun.com</p></blockquote><p class="P3">I'll do that. </p></div>

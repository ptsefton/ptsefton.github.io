ICE is now [listed on
ASK-OSS](http://ask-oss.mq.edu.au/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=42&Itemid=69):

> The Australian Service for Knowledge of Open Source Software (ASK-OSS)
> provides a national focal point for advice, management, governance,
> storage and dissemination of Open Source Software (OSS) for research
> and higher education. ASK-OSS provides unbiased, pragmatic guidance
> on: selection of appropriate OSS for research; choosing appropriate
> OSS licenses; management/governance for OSS development; and storage
> and community development of OSS.

Just like [RUBRIC](http://www.rubric.edu.au/), where I work “ASK-OSS is
a Department of Education, Science and Training funded initiative as
part of the MERRI round of SII under the Backing Australia's Ability
initiative.”

<h1>A word plugin for OpenDocument? Maybe.</h1>
<a href="/">Home</a>-<a href="/blog/index.html">blog</a>-<a href="/blog/2006/index.html">2006</a>-<a href="/blog/2006/05/index.html">05</a>-<a href="/blog/2006/05/11/index.html">11</a>
<div><p class="P1">Some people from something called <a href="http://opendocument.us/">The OpenDocument Foundation</a> say they have developed an OpenDocument read/write plugin for Microsoft Word. But they don't say it on their own website (and their website is actually a frameset pointing to another very unimpressive site at <a href="http://www.theequityexchange.com/">http://www.theequityexchange.com</a>).</p><p>I read about this on <a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20060504015438308">Groklaw</a>, via <a href="http://www.solidoffice.com/archives/282">SolidOffice</a>.</p><p>The claim published on Groklaw says, in part:</p><blockquote class="bq"><p>The testing has been extensive and thorough. As far as we can tell there isn't a problem, even with Accessibility add ons, which as you know is a major concern for Massachusetts.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="bqs"><p><a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=2006050401543830">http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=2006050401543830</a></p></blockquote><p>I'm skeptical. </p><p>Why? There is, as Microsoft has repeatedly claimed, a mismatch between the features in Microsoft Office and OpenDocument. <b>There is definitely such a mismatch</b> between Word and the most-used application that uses OpenDocument which is OpenOffice.org. That is, there are things that won't map between the applications. </p><p>For example, <b>OpenDocument has styles for lists and Word doesn't</b>. The OpenOffice.org solution to this involves creating new list styles like <code>WW8Num1</code> when you load a word document, even if that document was created three minutes ago in OpenOffice.org and used a list style called <code>li1n</code>. This is causing us lots of trouble on the <a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/svn/ice/downloads/latest/documentation/packages/ice-guide/ice-guide_template.zip">ICE project</a>, but we will write macros and other code to fix the problem because we use paragraph styles to carry the important information about our ICE document. Paragraph styles are similar enough between word processors that they do tend to interoperate pretty well. </p><p>So what will this magic plugin do when you open an OpenOffice.org-created document in Word? I'd love to see.</p><p><b>Going the other way</b>, Word has an outline feature the lets any paragraph participate in an outline whereas in OpenOffice.org you are restricted to using a single set of heading styles. I did check the OpenDocument spec and it appears to me that this limitation is built in to the format.</p><p>There are lots, lots more examples that will come up and keep coming up, but the ICE team will keep on finding solutions and working on the documentation (you can download a zip <a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/svn/ice/downloads/latest/documentation/packages/ice-guide/ice-guide_template.zip">here</a> – but it will soon be online).</p><p>In ICE, we don't care so much about <b>full interoperability</b> between Word and OpenOffice.org Writer, we care are about knowing what is the set of features that you can to <b>allow interoperability</b>. So I'd love to get my hands on the OpenDocument Foundation's plugin if and when they decide to release it.</p><p>(Yes I  know there are supposed to be other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_applications_supporting_OpenDocument">word processors that support OpenDocument</a> but for now OpenOffice.org is the one that matters to the people I'm working with. Try following the links to IBM to see if you can find out anything about their word processor, if there is one. I gave up after a few minutes of reading the same uninformative stuff repeated on different pages.)</p><p></p><p></p></div>

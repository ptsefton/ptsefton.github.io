It took me a very long time to decide but in December I bought a new
commuting-to-work bicycle. It's a [Trek
520](http://www2.trekbikes.com.au/catalogue.cgi?rm=product&mp;product_id=16&category_id=3&subcategory_id=32)
touring bike, the Taiwanese version, not the American version which
means it has a different kind of gear-changing and brake-lever system
and it is \$200 cheaper.

I thought I'd post about it here because I used the web a lot in my
research and I learned a lot of stuff that I didn't know before.

Actually, I tried to buy a cheaper Fuji touring bike, from a shop in
Brisbane (web site not worth a link at this stage) but they couldn't get
one and were not always too good at getting back to me on the phone, and
I talked to the[bike shop in Sydney that fixed Tom Worthington's broken
bendy
bike](http://www.tomw.net.au/blog/2005/10/bending-bicycle-better.html)but
they don't do email all that well. And their site is very long on
obscure cool, pictures of bikes and loads of jargon, and very short on
information – my first email to them was to ask if they sold actual
bikes, 'cos I couldn't really tell.

In the end I went to the [LBS](http://www.bikeline.com.au/) (the Local
Bike Shop) and bought the Trek 520 having only seen a smaller one in a
shop in Sydney that must have been last year's model. It's not the kind
of thing they keep on the floor of their shop in Toowoomba. Ordering, I
hoped that the back wheel would not be untrue (ie bent) like the one on
the \$320 worth of Chinese mountain bike, now my shopping bike, which I
bought from the LBS five years ago.

The 520 is called a touring bike, but I use it as a commuter. There are
plenty of complaints out there on the web that it's not a real touring
bike; ie not suitable for riding over big mountain ranges with 50-plus
kilos of gear in panniers front and back and a handlebar bag, and a rack
bag on the rear. People have concerns that the wheels and the rack might
not be strong enough for that and the gears are not low enough.

I think of the touring bit more like the touring in GT – ie [Grand
Tourer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GT_car), built to be comfortable
for long distances at reasonable speed, not designed to be a truck –
although [this
review](http://www.roadbikereview.com/cat/latest-bikes/touring-bike/trek/PRD_291208_5675crx.aspx)calls
it a tractor. Actually, it's just an old-fashioned bicycle.

If I do any tours in the short term I would take no more than what fits
in the rear panniers anyway.

The new bike has done about 450km, most of it in multiples of 7.6km
which is the shortest distance between work and home, and has been for
its free service with no problems and the wheels remain true. I do
[prefer it to any other way of getting to
work](http://www.bikeforums.net/archive/index.php/t-50156.html). I'm
expecting to do about 3000km a year on it...

# <span id="id768429"></span>I bought it because...

It has a **big frame...**
:   ...and so do I and it has drop-handlebars that mean I am bit more
    aerodynamic.

It has a 3 \* 27 drivetrain.
:   Triple chaining in the front and 9 gears at the back, making 27
    gears. The highest gear is **fast enough to be scary** for me,
    although I am getting used to going quicker as I learn to trust the
    brakes and the tyres. The lowest is 30 / 32 – meaning that one
    revolution of the pedal is nearly a revolution of the wheels.

It is designed for, and comes with, a back rack. 
:   I go to work with office clothes, lunch and a computer in a pair of
    old green [Wilderness Equipment Super Tour
    panniers](http://www.wildequipment.com.au/bicyclegear_superrp.html)
    that I love, and more often than not stop to buy milk, bread, meat,
    veges on the way home from work, often adding up to an extra 10kg or
    so. Other people have complained online about the rack on the 520
    but it looks OK to me and comes with a very nice little elastic
    strap.
:   There are little holes to mount a front rack if I need it for a
    longer tour, like I'm going to get a chance to do that.

The frame is made of a steel alloy.
:   I assume the frame will last for a long time and will flex a bit and
    not crack like some aluminum alloy frames.

It is a good quality bike...
:   ...with good components that work properly together and will not
    fall apart after a few thousand kilometres like the components on
    the last bike where brake levers and rear axle have needed replacing
    and other parts are getting dodgy. At least the theory is that they
    will not fall apart.

It's an ordinary upright bike. 
:   I looked into [recumbent
    bikes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recumbent_bike) but no matter
    what they all say on their websites, and they all seem to have a
    section on how safe it all is, I think that the lower you are the
    more likely you are to be hit by a motorist of some kind. And they
    cost more for the same level of components. And they are said to be
    slow going up hills.

# <span id="id768192"></span>Stuff I discovered later...

Miscellaneous

:   -   Everything is held together with [Allen
        keys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_wrench) these days,
        apparently, including making the seat go up and down and
        fiddling with the handlebars.

    -   The tyres are skinnier than the slicks I used to have on my old
        yellow, much loved Shogun mountain bike that was stolen in the
        year 2000, and they **seem to be faster**, but they're still
        pretty fat, meaning they are reasonably stable on gravel and not
        too harsh to ride on.

    -   **Rides well**, whatever that means. People talk about the steel
        frame flexing and so on, which I really can't tell, but I find
        it much more satisfying to ride than the old mountain bike, also
        steel, and I get where I'm going much quicker.

    -   The **STI gear/brake levers are a really good idea**. Long
        distance touring types distrust them but they let you change
        gears and stop the bicycle, from lots of different positions on
        the handlebars without shifting your hands around.

    -   The much maligned **saddle seems alright** to me, but I have
        never used a really good one, and I have not spent more than
        about an hour at a time on this bike, usually much less.

    -   It has **mud guards** (fenders) to stop the rider and his hi-vis
        green shirt from getting too wet and muddy should it ever rain
        again in Toowoomba. Daniel De Byl from the [ICE
        project](http://ice.usq.edu.au/)says they make it look like a
        girl's bike, but then his nickname is Kylie (doesn't like being
        called Danny). I like them, even if they make me look like a
        girl but the website doesn't mention them.

Pedals

:   
:   I didn't consider this at all until after I had put down my deposit,
    but the bike comes with special [Shimano SPD clipless
    pedals](http://www.sheldonbrown.com/gloss_cl.html#clipless) (have a
    look around **Sheldon Brown's site,** very very useful and
    entertaining).
:   I gave it a hundred km or so with no toe-sticking-on-device at all,
    which feels very very dangerous after years of riding with old
    fashioned toe-straps that stop your feet from slipping off and give
    you a bit of extra power. Then I bolted on some \$8 KMart toe straps
    while I considered spending more money on fancy shoes.
:   During this phase I found that both sans-straps and with the toe
    straps my feet would **often hit the front wheel** when maneuvering
    at low speed; annoying and possibly dangerous. But this problem went
    away when I finally bought the [Specialized Body Geometry Comp MTB
    shoes](http://specialized.com/bc/SBCEqProduct.jsp?spid=12749) 'cos
    the other Toowoomba LBS **** had a pair in size 48 that some other
    person with largish feet had ordered-in and not bought, and they let
    me have them cheap.
:   For those of you who don't know, the SPD pedals come with **little
    bits of metal called cleats**. You buy a pair of special shoes with
    rigid soles, take off the not-special little bits of metal that come
    screwed to them and bolt on the special cleats in their place. Then
    you adjust everything with Allen keys so that you can make your feet
    stick to the pedals by pushing down at just the right angle (kind of
    like putting on skis mid piste at first) and you can **twist your
    heel to make the pedals let go**.

I know nothing about cycle shoes apart from the above but:
1.  I have **not fallen off,** if you don't count the incident with the
    already broken plastic table outside our garage and the nonchalant
    lean-on-the-table-with-the-feet-clipped-in.

2.  The **connection with the bike** does seem to be effective, and yes
    they do seem to help with hill climbing.

3.  I didn't lose all the **spare little screws** that hold the cleats
    in place, just a few of them until I figured out to **do them up
    really tight**.

4.  They make **my toes go numb** on the way to work, which is kind of
    comforting, reminds me of walking boots and climbing boots and ski
    boots that make your feet hurt while you have fun. Toes don't go
    numb on the way home, but that's mostly downhill. And it doesn't
    hurt.

# <span id="id767575"></span>Bad stuff

The only dodgy bit is nothing to do with the Trek 520, it's the the
Sigma cycle computer. I got the shop to put on a model with a
[cadence](http://www.sheldonbrown.com/gloss_ca-m.html#cadence) measuring
feature that tells you how fast your feet are going around in
revolutions per minute – handy to know if you ever need to pedal a
gramophone I suppose. The little magnet on the crank fell off shortly
after I bought the bike, and the LBS replaced it but now the thing
doesn't work even though it is still there. I knew it was still there
because it started making a click click click noise about 90 times a
minute on the way to work yesterday. It's not meant to do that, it's
meant to work with magnetism, not percussion. Today it fell apart and
there's a broken thingie inside that must have once been the magnetic
switch.

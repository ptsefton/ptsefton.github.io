<h1>How the ICE Python came to be</h1>

<div><p>I've been reading stuff on programming languages via Tim Bray's <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/03/05/Languages-Today">ongoing site</a>. I liked the pieces by Steve Yegge, who now chooses Ruby. What's more he has a bike analogy:</p><blockquote class="bq"><p>If languages are bicycles, then Awk is a pink kiddie bike with a white basket and streamers coming off the handlebars, Perl is a beach cruiser (remember how cool they were? Gosh.) and Ruby is a $7,500 titanium mountain bike. The leap from Perl to Ruby is as significant as the leap from C++ to Java, but without any of the downside, because Ruby's essentially a proper superset of Perl's functionality, whereas Java took some things away that people missed, and didn't offer real replacements for them. </p><p><a href="http://www.cabochon.com/~stevey/blog-rants/tour-de-babel.html">http://www.cabochon.com/~stevey/blog-rants/tour-de-babel.html</a> </p></blockquote><p>(I have never ridden a $7,500 titanium mountain bike, but maybe I can find out what it's like by writing some Ruby.)</p><p>I thought this might be a good time to talk about why we chose to write the cross-platform publishing Integrated Content Environment (ICE) in Python about a year ago.</p><ol class="lin"><li><p>We needed to integrate with OpenOffice.org which ships with Python built-in, so there's likely to be lots of example of Python code to draw on.</p></li><li><p>While we had a team well qualified and practiced with Java, none of us had any confidence that we could get a cross platform Java application to run correctly. I couldn't get simple applets written by the USQ team to run in Firefox at the time and I simply dreaded having to go to Sun's site to download Java! Which one do I need? JDK, JRE who knows? And how do I run a Java thing I've downloaded? Classpath? What?</p></li><li><p>Python allows us to compile stand-alone applications for Windows and OS X.</p></li><li><p><a href="http://chandler.osafoundation.org/">Chandler</a>, the new über Personal Information Manager project  is using Python. The OSAF team did their homework and bet on Python. And ICE was aimed at a similar community, starting with Higher Education just like Chandler. One day ICE, or part of it may even become a Chandler module.</p></li><li><p><b>Python is a good language</b>, mostly consistent and easy to test. I think that Python's whitespace makes for readable, more consistent code, It bypasses the need to document at least some aspects of a coding standard. </p><p>We use <a href="http://codespeak.net/py/current/doc/test.html">py.test</a> for our unit test framework, in addition to <a href="https://utf-x.dev.java.net/">UTF-X</a> for testing XSLT.</p></li></ol><p>Some things are less than ideal.</p><p>Python has pretty feeble native XML support, lacking the crucial XPath and XSLT out of the box. We use <a href="http://xmlsoft.org/">libxml2 and libsxtl</a>, which work in not very Pythonic way but get the job done.</p><p>But why not Ruby, and possibly Rails?</p><p>Ruby's profile a year ago was nothing like it is now so we didn't really consider it. I think if we were to start ICE now, it would be worth a look. It <b>can</b> be <a href="http://www.erikveen.dds.nl/rubyscript2exe/index.html">compiled into stand-alone executables</a> just like Python. There would be lots of work to do, though to find out about subversion libraries and OpenOffice.org integration.</p><p><b></b></p></div>

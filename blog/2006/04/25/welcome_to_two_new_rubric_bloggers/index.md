RUBRIC has two more bloggers. I'll be linking to specific stuff on these
sites soon.

Caroline Ayers has started [the Cat's
Meow](http://sophiaca.wordpress.com/). I'm allergic to cat fur, but I
think meows are safe enough.

Corey Wallis has created [Tech
Explorer](http://techxplorer.wordpress.com/).

You can subscribe to either of their sites using an RSS reader like
[bloglines](http://bloglines.com/), or you can watch and/or subscribe to
the del.icio.us tag [destrubric](http://del.icio.us/tag/destrubric) and
anything relevant to RUBRIC generally should show up there, while posts
of a more technical nature will show up under
[destrubrictechteam](http://del.icio.us/tag/destrubrictechteam) â€“ either
the author will self-tag it or if they're shy someone else can.

Now where's Cameron Loudon's blog I wonder?

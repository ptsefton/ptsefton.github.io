At work we have been using virtual servers to manage multiple
installations of Institutional Repository software on a single physical
server. It's like we have our own room full of computers. I should have
been doing this years ago.

I had been planning to write something here about the joys of virtual
servers, but two better qualified people from the RUBRIC technical team
beat me to it.

1.  Caroline Ayers [writes about her
    experiences](http://sophiaca.wordpress.com/2006/04/21/virtualisation-and-irs-–-part-1/)
    regarding the RUBRIC project on her blog. Caroline writes that
    virtualisation has worked out very well for us in hosting complete
    self contained demonstration systems for our partners:

2.  And Corey Wallis has added a technical report to the [RUBRIC
    site](http://www.rubric.edu.au/techreports/default.htm). Won't be
    hard to find it's the only one there for now – lots more to come
    soon.

By coincidence Rick Jelliffe just [wrote about his
experiences](http://www.oreillynet.com/xml/blog/2006/04/the_super_fat_client.html).
Rick notes that it now doesn't really matter what operating system
you're using. I agree – I use Mac OS X, but the main applications I use,
like Firefox and OpenOffice.org are available on Windows and Linux as
well and like Rick I use Eclipse for programming. (I do like Apple's
Mail application, mainly because of the fast searching but I hate that
it and iCal will not play nicely with the Microsoft Exchange server used
at work).

Rick speculates about where this is taking us:

As for me, I have just dipped a toe in the virtual water with a
(free-as-in-beer) VM Ware 'player' virtual machine running on a Windows
XP box at home.

Why? I am considering getting an entire machine (either physical or
virtual) hosted for me so I can host ICE repositories, and try out an
idea I have for an online word processing to HTML conversion service.
The service provider I was considering offered Debian Linux, although I
would have preferred Ubuntu.

So to practice I started with a minimal Debian [virtual
appliance](http://www.vmware.com/vmtn/appliances/index.html) and let it
install a full desktop system via the 'net. Took all day, including me
doing stupid stuff like killing the network connection in the middle of
the install and the resulting virtual computer was stupidly slow until I
added an extra 512MB of RAM to the feeble 256 I had in the physical
machine.

Now it turns out the ISP does offer Ubuntu – must have just added it –
so I'll try again with Ubuntu. If all goes well, then I can probably
turn off my \$25 Linux computer soon – it's sitting here [heating the
home office](http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/004350.html) and not
doing very much – why not just run it off the Windows machine that gets
left on all the time anyway and give the old computer to someone else?
Someone else with extremely modest computing needs, that is.

The ICE-RS (integrated content environment for research and scholarship)
project got a mention in the USQ news. Unfortunately [that's a
PDF](http://www.usq.edu.au/resources/usqenews18augfinal.pdf). But there
are two nearly identical pictures of me which makes it all worthwhile.
It's on page 8. You'll probably want to read on to page 9 too.

the [ICE](http://ptsefton.com/blog/2006/08/02/ice-rs) project will be at
the IDEA conference, Victoria University Flinders Street Campus,
Melbourne Australia 9-12 October 2006.

We'll be holding a couple of events.

I've copied the announcement below, and you can look at the [IDEA

attention to:

Â 

As a followup to the very successful IDEA 2004 and IDEA Summer 2005
events, the Australian Department of Education, Science and Training
(DEST) and Multimedia Victoria (MMV) would like to invite you to IDEA
2006, a series of e-learning events to be held at the Flinders Street
Campus of Victoria University in Melbourne from 9 - 12 October, 2006.

## <span id="id3566625"></span>Purpose

There is growing recognition that Australians need access to quality
online educational resources and services to support learning and
research. To meet this demand, educational resources and services are
increasingly being used beyond the bounds of their original
organisations. The IDEA 2006 events will focus on common integration and
interoperability solutions that enable these types of integrated
e-learning environments.

## <span id="id1251007"></span>Format

IDEA 2006 is a series of workshops and forums spread over four days,
each catering for slightly different audiences. For event details,
please visit the DEA 2006 website:<span class="T2"> </span>[<span

## <span id="id1249729"></span>Who should attend?

Those involved in planning, deploying and developing e-learning
infrastructure and services for higher education. ICT managers
responsible for e-learning infrastructure, vendors wishing to integrate
their services into e-learning infrastructure, implementors of
e-learning technology.

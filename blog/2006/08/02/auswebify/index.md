The <span>Ausweb [[HREF1]](http://ausweb.scu.edu.au/)</span> conference
is all about the World Wide Web. The papers are made available, not in
PDF, but in HTML. Attendees get a print version of the proceedings. (You
can read <span>my paper
[[HREF2]](http://ausweb.scu.edu.au/aw06/papers/refereed/sefton/index.html)</span>
on <span>ICE [[HREF3]](http://ice.usq.edu.au/)</span>).

There is an interesting convention for referencing in <span>Ausweb
[[HREF1]](http://ausweb.scu.edu.au/)</span> papers, which as far as I
know has no name, and is only explained to authors by example. The idea
is that hypertext references are footnoted (but still linked) so that
they make sense in the paper version. You can see it in action here in
this very post. For example I have links on the word <span>Ausweb
[[HREF1]](http://ausweb.scu.edu.au/)</span> in my original document in
OpenOffice.org writer, but you see only footnote references.

I looked around the web for a script to do this to an HTML document â€“
but there doesn't seem to be one so I made one and plugged it into my
ICE site. This is the result. I can 'Auswebify' any <span>ICE
[[HREF3]](http://ice.usq.edu.au/)</span> document at the click of a
button. This is not too much use yet 'cos I'm the only one who has it,
but if anyone out there is interested <span>email me
[[HREF4]](mailto:pt@ptsefton.com)</span>.

Things to do:

-   Make a stand alone version that Ausweb authors, or better yet the
    organizers can run.

-   Make the code into an 'ICE plugin'. Only problem being ICE doesn't
    do plugins yet. But it will.

-   Add it to our coming bibliographic support in ICE as an option for
    PDF files.

-   Talk more to Ausweb people about using the conference as an ICE-RS
    pilot to show how people might work in a word processor and submit
    to the conference automatically. Andrew Treloar was encouraging
    about this idea, now that we have funding we can start lining up
    pilots.

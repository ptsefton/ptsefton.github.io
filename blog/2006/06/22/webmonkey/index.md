I was reading an OK article on webmonkey (The Web Developer's Resource)
and thought I'd see whether they take articles from outsiders. Couldn't
find any obvious links on how to send a proposal, so I tried searching.
**Write for webmonkey** returned no results, as did **webmonkey** and
**html**. Didn't Lycos used to be a search company?

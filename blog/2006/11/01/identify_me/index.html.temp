<h1>Does a text citation make a good persistent identifier?</h1>
<a href="/">Home</a>-<a href="/blog/index.html">blog</a>-<a href="/blog/2006/index.html">2006</a>-<a href="/blog/2006/11/index.html">11</a>-<a href="/blog/2006/11/01/index.html">01</a>
<div><p class="P1">We've been talking about persistent identifiers at RUBRIC: how are people going to name the things in their repository so they can be cited and located in the future? We're looking to the  PILIN project (read a presentation in <a href="http://www.arrow.edu.au/docs/files/PILIN-IDEA-20061010.pdf">PDF</a> or <a href="http://www.arrow.edu.au/docs/files/PILIN-IDEA-20061010.txt">text</a>) for some advice. Expect to see more on this topic here over the next few months.</p><p>Lots of repositories use <a href="http://www.handle.net/">Handles</a> to name things and the handle infrastructure for naming things and storing metadata about them is pretty impressive; but others, like USQ have yet to buy-in and <a href="http://norman.walsh.name/2006/07/25/namesAndAddresses">some people</a> think that URIs are perfectly good names. Me, I'm still confused.</p><p>Anyway, a practical problem: how do you refer to an item in the <a href="http://eprints.usq.edu.au/">USQ ePrints repository</a>?</p><p>How about a plain-text citation? This identifies something; it's a perfectly good name.</p><blockquote class="bq"><p>"Sefton, Peter (2006) The integrated content environment. In: AusWeb06: The 12th Australasian World Wide Web Conference, 1-5 July 2006, Noosa, Australia."</p></blockquote><p>My theory was that I could use Google as a resolver to find versions of the paper by doing a phrase search but that doesn't work. The full citation with the quotes yields nothing. Without the quotes Google takes me to the ePrints <a href="http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00000697/">page</a>. But <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=sfp&amp;p=Sefton%2C+Peter+(2006)+The+integrated+content+environment.+In%3A+AusWeb06%3A+The+12th+Australasian+World+W">Yahoo</a> finds it using a phrase search. So does <a href="http://search.ninemsn.com.au/results.aspx?q=%22Sefton%2C+Peter+(2006)+The+integrated+content+environment.+In%3A+AusWeb06%3A+The+12th+Australasian+World+Wide+Web+Conference%2C+1-5+July+2006%2C+Noosa%2C+Australia.%22&amp;geovar=70&amp;FORM=REDIR">MSN</a>.</p><p>USQ ePrints has a version of the paper in PDF format but the actual paper is available from the conference web site in HTML format. As I write this there's no link from ePrints to the version at the conference; I'll see if I can get that added.</p><p>You can find the version of the paper at the conference web site by searching  for AusWeb06, then clicking through the<a href="http://ausweb.scu.edu.au/aw06/papers/refereed/sefton/index.html"> days of the program</a> (I was on Tuesday). </p><p>There is a also a paper version of the proceedings – so of course you can <a href="http://nla.gov.au/anbd.bib-an000040588911">find that</a> via  the National Library of Australia. (I searched to ausweb06). That finds the proceedings of the conference: <i>AusWeb06 : Making a Difference with Web Technologies / Treloar, Andrew(ed), Ellis, Allan(ed).</i> Maybe we could update the ePrints repository to use this as part of the citation but if we do that then the links in this post will eventually break – the citation I used  in this post will no longer be there. </p><p>At this stage its looking like the plain text citation is not a particularly good persistent name if you want automated resolution, but on the other hand a human being can use it find the paper, and it should work in a post-Internet world.</p><p>My understanding of handles is that you should be able to link all the different versions of the paper by storing URLs as metadata against a single name, the handle resolver service could be used to point to any one of those versions, or you could make a service that threw up a page where people could choose. </p><p>The handle could, in theory be like this (where n would be a number): <code>1959.n/"Sefton, Peter (2006) The integrated content environment. In: AusWeb06: The 12th Australasian World Wide Web Conference, 1-5 July 2006, Noosa, Australia."</code></p><p>Except that I have heard some people say that this kind of  local name (that's the bit after the /) is a bad idea and names should be meaningless. I don't understand that bit yet – maybe it's because of the issue I noted above with the wording of the citation. </p><p>We're working through lots of practical issues to do with naming, citing and locating things on the <a href="http://rubric.edu.au/">RUBRIC</a> and <a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/introduction/ice_rs.htm">ICE-RS </a>projects – more soon.</p></div>

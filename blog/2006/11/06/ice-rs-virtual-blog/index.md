If you'd like to keep in touch with all things related to
 [ICE-RS](http://ice.usq.edu.au/introduction/ice_rs.htm) (The Integrated
Content Environment for Research and Scholarship) then you can look at
this del.icio.us page: <http://del.icio.us/icers>.

We've created an account for the ICE-RS project and we'll use it to
bookmark things of interest: stuff on the ICE site, posts on this site
and any resources that are of interest to ICE-RS pilot users, friends
and family.

You can use an
[aggregator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_aggregator) to keep track
of this site, the icers del.icio.us account and many other web pages.

> Aggregators reduce the time and effort needed to regularly check
> websites for updates, creating a unique information space or "personal
> newspaper." Once subscribed to a feed, an aggregator is able to check
> for new content at user-determined intervals and retrieve the update.
> The content is sometimes described as being "pulled" to the
> subscriber, as opposed to "pushed" with email or IM. Unlike recipients
> of some "pushed" information, the aggregator user can easily
> unsubscribe from a feed.

I use [http://reader.google.com](http://reader.google.com/) – if you
have a gmail account give it a go (and if you want a gmail account let
me know), [http://newsgator.com](http://newsgator.com/) has an OK
aggregator, and [http://bloglines.com](http://bloglines.com/) is still
going. There are others.

Today is the first day of work on the
 [ICE-RS](http://ice.usq.edu.au/introduction/ice_rs.htm) (The Integrated
Content Environment for Research and Scholarship) project, in a quiet
sort of a way.

Daniel de Byl starts today as the ICE-RS Project Officer. Ron Ward also
starts. He's in the  Analyst/Programmer position only he's on leave this
week.

Daniel will spend this week getting some of the basics sorted out;
getting ICE 1.0 released., updating the website content and
architecture, sorting out a way to provide updates via RSS and figuring
out how we'll run the fortnightly engineering cycles. The first round of
ICE-RS development will start on 2006-11-14.

We'll run ICE-RS off the publicly accessible
[http://ice.usq.edu.au](http://ice.usq.edu.au/) and use that virtual
server to host content for the ICE-RS pilots. By default this will be
over HTTP – which is much faster than the more secure HTTPS. We'll also
switch over to using a publicly accessible Trac server so everyone can
see what we're up to. At this stage I think that access to add to the
wiki will be by invitation or application only; and only the core ICE-RS
team will have commit privileges for code.

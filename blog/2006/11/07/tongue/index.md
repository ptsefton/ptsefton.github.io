So far I have mostly resisted the temptation to share with you some of
the search strings that people use to find this site. But [*I want a
longer
tongue*?](http://www.google.com.au/search?q=i+want+a+longer+tongue&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a)

Earlier this year I wrote about Content Management with a long tongue.
That's what we're on about on the [ICE-RS
project](http://ice.usq.edu.au/introduction/ice_rs.htm); extending the
reach of the institutional repository back to the authoring process. The
long tongue bit came from Tim O'Reilly's
[reference](http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/01/the_long_snout.html)
to the 'long snout' on O'Reilly's in-house Aardvark publishing system,
about which I can't find any information.

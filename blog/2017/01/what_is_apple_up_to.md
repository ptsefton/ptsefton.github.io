Summary: The internet is concerned that Apple is not producing the
kind of high performance hardware their most demanding customers
(devs, creatives) want. I think Apple understands what these customers
want; high performance general purpose computers, with a well designed
operating system optimised for extensibility and longevity rather than
for weight and size. But I think Apple wants to optimise something
else and that is the amount of revenue they get after they sell the
hardware. I suspect they may be looking to turn the MacOS platform
into a closed system, like iOS, where they can control distribution of
*everything*, including applications & content, continuing the moves
they have been making with the app store, changing the way file
dialogs work, etc. This would not suit the developer community at all;
maybe the plan is to jettison as many as possible of these before the
lock-down begins.


Back in 2007-ish I remember all the silvery Mac laptops that started
appearing at the the tech conferences I attended. Seemed like all the cool
kids had Macs, cos there was a *Real Operating System* underneath, and
you could even run X-Windows. 

[Von Rospach] (via [Daring
Fireball])  joins the chorus pointing out that Apple aren't looking
after their power-user customers. Has Apple lost its way? Why didn't
last year's MacBook Pro computers come with more memory? Why haven't
they updated the MacPro? There is genuine puzzlement.  Don't they
realise they're losing their most influential customers?  Don't they
care about the [musicians]?

He thinks analysis might be the problem:

> Defining products by the spreadsheet: A big percentage of complaints
> over the new MacBook Pro devices is that they ignore the needs of
> the “power” user.  I think a better way to define this is that these
> units define “power user ” different than many people who see
> themselves as power users do, and they’re upset (justifiably) that
> there aren’t options that allow them to solve their needs.

> The problem? This group is fairly small and have needs living well
> towards the end of the bell curve. They are, effectively, a niche
> within the niche that the Mac now finds itself in. Apple seems to
> have made business decisions not to support this group. Why?

Von Rospach goes on:

> My worry is that Apple isn’t seeing this, because it’s looking at
> the sales numbers and they look fine, with many products under
> backlog and strong demand (including the new MacBook Pros). If you
> just look at the numbers, things are okay. But what Apple’s always
> been good at is looking beyond the numbers to the things they don’t
> say — and I worry they’ve lost that.

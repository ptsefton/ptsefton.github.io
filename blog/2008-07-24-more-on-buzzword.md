Two people have recently reminded me about Adobe's online word
processor, [Buzzword](https://buzzword.acrobat.com/). Coincidence?
Groundswell of popularity? Probably not as they are married to each
other.

Anyway, it has improved a bit since I first [looked at
it](http://ptsefton.com/blog/2007/10/03/10-01-45.649977/). At least it
has HTML export now (it handles lists wrongly, nesting lists inside
lists instead of inside list items, but that's a common mistake). Still
no styles or headings and I fear that it is trying to get people to lock
up their documents in some kind of proprietary Flash and/or PDF format.

Adobe are asking for feedback so I [gave some over at the Acrobat.com
blogs](http://blogs.adobe.com/acom/2008/06/buzzword_looking_ahead.html).

I think that there's an opportunity to Adobe to do what I Google should
have done with Google Docs (used to be Writely). I suggested this:

> What could be done differently over at Writely so they can reliably
> import documents and get the lists right, and better still, let people
> start off in Writely online and produce word processing docs to send
> out to others?
>
> The Writely / Google people could design a well thought out, freely
> available generic word processing template that works more or less
> equally well in various different word processing environments (hint -
> you'll need some clean-up code to help the poor word processors keep
> their lists straight).

I think Buzzword should not only [use
styles](http://del.icio.us/ptsefton/usestyles), it should get a well
designed set of generic styles as a basis and the Adobe folks should
build templates which are Buzzword compatible <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> the online service that does this first
has the best chance of bridging the gap from the offline to the online
world.

If I create a document in Buzzword why not make the default export to
Word use some Adobe-defined styles and give the user a buzzword-like
toolbar to play with them, post the doc back to Buzzword etc? In all the
online word processors I have tried import and export is appalling and
I'm sure this must slow adoption.

At the moment all the online word processors are far behind on features
that are needed for some documents, you couldn't write a thesis in
Buzzword (not if you wanted tables of contents and figures and numbering
and reference management) but you could draft some stuff in there or
collaborate on papers then export into Word, or FrameMaker or something
to finish the job. Here a well thought out style set would really help
with interop.

(Someone from Google did, but the conversation didn't go anywhere). The
[ICE project](http://ice.usq.edu.au/) has some templates you might like
to look at.

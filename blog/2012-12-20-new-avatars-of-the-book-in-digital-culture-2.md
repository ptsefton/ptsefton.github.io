# New Avatars of the Book in Digital Culture

<section>
## Why are we here?

This week the University of Western Sydney held a symposium, New Avatars
of the Book in Digital Culture. I was invited to contribute to the
event, in my capacity as eResearch manager. One member of my team
thought it meant I was going to get to slap on the blue body paint, but
sadly it wasn’t that kind of Avatar.

> This symposium focuses on the changing nature and status of those
> peculiarly useful interactive objects we call ‘books’ in online
> contexts. In contrast to web-pages, files, ‘sites’ and ‘contexts’ of
> reading, the book still presents a useful model of rich ‘containment’
> and productive constraint.

> online environments?  What forms of interface can be envisioned

In this context I didn’t want to present too formally but prepared some
notes for the discussion, after the keynote talks. This post contains my
pre-event note/slides and a few observations from the event.

</section>
<section>
## The keynotes

The keynotes were both really engaging discussions of digital culture
(not so much the book).

Mitchell Whitelaw, from Canberra University [talked
about](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lY4V0yXN2yqpubXVJsxsZWj4SMIPkkvaLzyEPkvkJ9Q/edit)
building “[generous
interfaces](http://visiblearchive.blogspot.com.au/2012/10/manly-images-generous-prototype.html)”
to online databases. The idea is to enable a browse-based interface that
attempts to show as many entry points to a collection as possible.
Mitchell’s visual tools allow you to see the shape of large archival
collections and explore them using both visual cues and metadata facets
such as dates or creators. Dan Cohen recently [asked how this might work
for university web
sites](http://www.dancohen.org/2012/12/05/generous-interfaces-for-scholarly-sites/),
I can’t see how, but it’s an interesting design challenge (hint for uni
web teams – the big images that take up a third or more of the screen
and change all the time don’t improve the utility of the site).

Mitchell talked a bit in the discussion about how a ‘generous’ book
interface might look, showing the ‘weight’ of items in the Table of
Contents, giving a sense of the shape of a work,  a potential site for
further research.

[Jason Nelson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Nelson), [from
Griffith](http://www.griffith.edu.au/humanities-languages/school-humanities/staff/mr-jason-nelson)
uni talked about his practice as a digital poet, which didn’t involve
any pretentious reading out loud, but did involve an array of amusing,
rude and occasionally moving online stuff, which I won’t attempt to
describe or critique it.

As Jason demoed various Flash and HTML stuff he’d made I was thinking
about all the problems he’d create for archivists, and indeed he does;
he told us about how he’d had to deposit screen-capture walk-throughs
into the Griffith repository as proxies for the actual games and
interactive poem-things he creates[<span
class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span
class="MsoFootnoteReference">[1]</span></span>](#_ftn1). He’s a textbook
example of the difficult-to-archive new media artist. See [game game
game and again
game](http://www.secrettechnology.com/gamegame/agame.html), which
apparently may ruin your life.

I was glad I didn’t have to follow Jason directly with my rather more
sedate stuff about techno-socio-political considerations, standards and
such. But at least my cut-price embedded slide-shows don’t look too
shabby compared to his low-tech, low-culture hand-drawn stuff.

## The readings

There were two readings for this symposium. One is a long essay
*Graphesis: Visual Knowledge Production and Representation* by Joanna

It’s a well-referenced survey of different approaches to “critical
understanding of visual knowledge production” with only passing
reference to books. I thought this was a really useful way of mapping
the jagged edges of a huge theoretical hole, but it doesn’t provide any
answers about how we might explore bookishness, or redefine the book.

The second reading is a piece from Alan Liu, <span property="cites"

which, I think, assumes that the end of the book is obvious, apparently
because we can put books online and search and tag them and dismember
them in an online environment. He cites three scholarly web applications
to demonstrate that books are dead, but I don’t really buy it. One of
them is the Open Journal Systems software, which is not about books
anyway, it’s a workflow system for managing journal production. Last
time I checked it was mostly used by editors to produce journals
consisting of PDF files, on the web but not *of* the web.

### The end of the sign?

![](/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/wpid-Avatars-of-the-book-copy.html.html_Avatars-of-the-book-copy_filesimage0022.gif)

We don’t herald the “end of the sign” just because people have annotated
a sign. And remember, books have *always* been ‘hypertextual’ via
referencing, quoting and wholesale stealing.

## The end of the book?

Liu says, in reference to some other symposium:

> As suggested by the title of this symposium (Bookishness: The New Fate
> of Reading in the Digital Age), the best way to think about the book
> in the digital age may well be to focus on bookishness. From the point
> of view of the digital, the book has already gone away. So the
> remaining question is “what happens to bookishness?” Or, again, “where
> does bookishness go?”

I don’t know where bookishness goes, or what happens to it.

From the point of view of this eResearch person books have not gone
away. And from the point of view of the digital (who knew the digital
had a point of view?) books have most emphatically not gone away and do
have digital analogues:

### Rumours of demise of book greatly exaggerated

That’s actually quite a lot of books, with no apparent existential
crisis. Not so many magazines; they’re not making the transition to
eReaders and tablets as happily as books. I think Craig Mod’s post on
‘[subcompact
publishing](http://craigmod.com/journal/subcompact_publishing/)’ is
worth reading on this issue, he looks at new models for magazine-like
publications which might work better than the current approach of
putting entire magazines into tablet apps complete with page-layout and
ads.

It goes without saying that an *e* book is different in many ways from a
*paper* book but nobody in the mainstream is having any trouble with the
concept of delivering or buying books digitally (though they may be less
relaxed when they finally realize that they’ve been renting the books,
not building the family library). Scholars can have all the fun they
like debating the demise of the form, and speculating about function,
but the book is obviously very much alive.

<section typeof="http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide">
### Craig Mod’s subcompact recipe

> I propose *Subcompact Publishing* tools and editorial ethos
> begin *(but not end)* with the following qualities:

-   Small issue sizes (3-7 articles / issue)

-   Small file sizes

-   Digital-aware subscription prices

-   Fluid publishing schedule

-   Scroll (don’t paginate)

-   Clear navigation

-   HTML(ish) based

-   Touching the open web

</section>

I think that Mod’s list of qualities looks like at least a good
check-list for any bookish project to consider.

The book is not the only bounded object to make the transition from the
physical to the virtual.

And the ‘album’ is still alive even in all-digital online distribution.
If the recorded-music-album can survive, and it obviously has, then the
much older book is no danger. In a nice bit of back-formation, the
scholars at Amazon have made the link between the book-omnibus or
magazine to the record-album and come up with a way of describing long
essays that they presumably feel a bit coy about marketing as eBooks.

I should point out that this workshop was not about the end of the book.
In fact, Maria Angel asked, in the introduction; how might the
constraints, and bounds of the book create an interesting space for
innovation?

When I raised preservation as an issue, Jason Nelson said (more or
less):

Good point – but don’t lose sight of the value of a professional
portfolio (and not everyone’s a rock-star internet poet like Jason :).

### eBooks *are* little web sites

-   HTML has more or less ‘won’ as the basis for most eBook formats.

-   EPUB is the standard. A book is essentially a (complicated)
    zipped-up website.

-   Beware of licensing/platform traps like the iBooks authoring
    application.

-   See the [JISC EPUB
    project](http://jiscpub.blogs.edina.ac.uk/final-report/), on which I
    worked in 2011.

-   Think about how to design things and interfaces to things that are
    driven by declarative markup (ie – be explict first, delightful

To finish, I tried to show a little of what is possible with declarative
semantically-marked up HTML5, as one potential means to create new
bookish things that might last.

-   Think about how to separate content from presentation and ‘engine’.
    (Might not be possible in some avant-garde experiments, but there
    are usually ways).

-   Consider standards-based experiments like [this one from Tim
    Sheratt](http://wraggelabs.com/shed/presentations/ndf2012/storydata/).

## Conclusion

Well, there isn’t a conclusion really as these are just notes but I’m
sure that continued work led by Anna and Maria and the Writing and
Society Research Centre will be critically important to UWS, seeing as
we’re the first Australian university to give [Every New Student a Free
iPad](http://www.uws.edu.au/learning_teaching/learning_and_teaching/ipad_initiative).

aspect of Jason’s work which I can’t talk about here which I think will
make a fantastic online case study in research data archiving. I’m going
to suggest it to the eResearch and repository staff at Griffith.

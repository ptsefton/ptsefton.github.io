<h1> 
An Australian Research Data Repository 
</h1>
<h2>2012-02-14 </h2>

<section itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ScholarlyArticle">
By Peter Sefton and Peter Bugeia, with input from the UWS eResearch
community and beyond
<section>
<h2>About this post</h2>
<p>During 2012 The University of Western Sydney (UWS) will be rolling out a
Research Data Repository (RDR). Peter Bugeia from Intersect put together
the project proposal which secured the budget to move ahead with this
project and Andrew (Alf) Leahy has been organising storage for research
groups on request, ahead of the RDR becoming properly operationalised.</p>
<p>Part of this RDR project will be a project funded by the Australian
National Data Service (<a href="http://ands.edu.au">ANDS</a>) under the Metadata
Stores programme. There will be a number of meetings over the next
couple of months where Australian Universities discuss how they are
going to spend their Metadata Stores money. There is a great opportunity
for organisations running similar software architectures and solutions
to pool their development resources; we’ve already spoken with Newcastle
about this. We hope this preliminary material will help others in the
community work out how much we have in common or tell us where we might
be able to improve things. More on that at the end of the post.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Before we go on, about that term ‘Metadata Stores’</h2>
<p>In <a href="http://ands.org.au/about/approach.html">ANDS speak</a>, a Metadata
Store is something that has all the metadata about research data and
associated entities like parties (people, organisations) and activities
(grant funded projects for example), in order that collection
descriptions (of research data) can be published to their search service
Research Data Australia
(<a href="http://services.ands.org.au/home/orca/rda/">RDA</a>).</p>
<p>But in many organisations we’re lacking the most important thing. We
don’t <strong>have</strong> the descriptions of research data to suck up into a
‘metadata store’.  Yes, there are data capture projects, lots of them
which will attempt to automate to some extent the packaging process, but
there’s a lot of stuff out there that won’t get captured this way. And
even with automated data capture, someone still has to write the human
readable description as a framework for the automated part. Many of us
are getting librarians involved in this enterprise Why? They’re good at
it. From a library point of view, this is a growth area, in a time when
many other functions of the library are changing and/or disappearing.</p>
<p>Describing collections is a key part of this whole ANDS agenda, which
strangely sometimes gets a bit forgotten. For example, in this <a href="http://ands.org.au/about/approach.html">diagram
from the ANDS website</a>,
“collection descriptions” appear only outside of the institution. When
working on these projects it’s important to keep thinking about where
these descriptions are going to come from.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/download1.png" alt=""></p>

Commons. But think: who's going to provide the descriptions in the
institution – they’re not going to manifest spontaneously as they appear
to here!</p>

<h2>The RDR</h2>
<p>The repository will consist of two main components:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>A scalable storage service linked to a combination of local and
cloud-based high performance computing</strong>. Some data may also reside
in other, trusted storage systems such as national infrastructure or
discipline repositories with suitable governance in place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A catalogue</strong> of research data for internal use in management, and
external use in dissemination and collaboration.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Unlike a typical monolithic Institutional Repository (IR) the storage
and catalogue services are disaggregated, because the data involved
can be large and is much more varied in nature than the typical
contents of an IR. Also, some data will reside in trusted data stores
outside of the central storage supplied by IT. Not to mention that
some of it is on paper and some on obsolete digital media<a href="#_ftn1"><span
class="MsoFootnoteReference"></span></a>.</p>
<p>But the project is about much more than supplying storage and
computing. It is about creating an organisational capability and
culture of managing research data throughout the research lifecycle.
We aim:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To <strong>enable research in all disciplines</strong> at UWS to take place
efficiently and effectively on existing and new data sets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To <strong>enable the validation of research</strong> through appropriate
management of data inputs and outputs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For <strong>re-use in new research</strong> which will cite the creators of
data sets at UWS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For <strong>compliance</strong> with funder requirements and codes of practice.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/download2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The RDR will be a locally governed service linked to national
infrastructure for dissemination of research data, data storage and
computing</p>
<p>The repository software stack will consist of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Scalable, managed file storage for both working and archived data,
including  any discipline-specific metadata describing that data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access to virtualized and non-virtualized computing infrastructure
at UWS, national and commercial facilities so that researchers can
run data analysis tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A research data catalogue containing metadata about data at a
collection level for code-compliance, strategic research management
and discovery purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interfaces to national research infrastructure including storage and
computing (RDSI, NCI, NeCTARetc).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The initial storage component of the RDR was established in 2010. The
next steps in the RDR project are to design the architecture that links
the storage to computing infrastructure and cataloguing applications,
and buy a lot more discs. This architectural work will be undertaken by
the eResearch Unit (That’s Peter Sefton, Andrew Leahy and our Intersect
eResearch Analyst Peter Bugeia),Information Technology Services, and the
University Library.</p>
<p>The RDR will serve several communities:</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Community</strong>                         <strong>RDR services</strong></p>
<p><strong>Researchers</strong>                       -   A safe place to put <strong>working data</strong>.</p>
<p>-   A platform for <strong>collaboration</strong> around data.</p>
<p>-   <strong>Archival storage</strong>, to meet researcher and departmental obligations to preserve data.</p>
<p>-   A platform for <strong>describing and advertising data sets</strong> for discovery and re-use.</p>
<p>-   A platform for <strong>publishing open access data</strong></p>
<p>-   A platform for <strong>protecting confidential or trade-secret data,</strong> managing embargoes and disposal dates.</p>
<p>-   Direct connection to <strong>scalable computing resources</strong>.</p>
<p>-   <strong>Minimal extra work for researchers</strong> over current interactions with ORS (grant applications, reporting etc).</p>
<p><strong>Office of Research Services</strong>       -   An institutional view of <strong>where data resides</strong>.</p>
<p>-   <strong>Integration with the research lifecycle</strong> and existing ORS systems</p>
<p>-   <strong>Improved visibility</strong> for UWS research</p>
<p><strong>The Library</strong>                       -   <strong>Curation tools for research-services librarians</strong> to describe data sets</p>
<p>-   Descriptions of data collections become <strong>part of the library’s holdings</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Information Technology Services</strong>   -   <strong>Consolidation</strong> of research data into one service model (currently storage provisioning is distributed and ad hoc).</p>
<p><strong>UWS eResearch team</strong>                -   University processes around the RDR will make it easier to <strong>identify where eResearch needs are at UWS</strong>.</p>
<p>-   <strong>Basic data storage is a ‘gateway’service</strong>for researchers into embracing more advanced computing and data-driven research (ieeResearch).</p>
<p><strong>General community</strong>                 -   The public will have an <strong>improved view of what research is conducted at UWS</strong>.</p>
<p>-   Potential future Australian Government or other <strong>reporting on data re-use and citation rates</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>External researchers</strong>              -   <strong>Discoverable data</strong>, people and projects</p>
<p>-   Immediate <strong>re-use of open-access data</strong> where possible</p>
<p>-   <strong>Mediated use data</strong> where possible, in collaborative projects or by arrangement with data creators</p>

<h2>Fitting in to UWS</h2>
<p>The RDR will be integrated with processes for managing the research
lifecycle. It is a design goal that all researcher interaction with the
system will have as little impact on the researchers as possible, by
aligning form-filling and bureaucracy with existing and/or inevitable
processes such as grant application or government reporting.</p>
<ol>
<li>Storage allocation will be tied to stages in the research lifecycle
where researchers already interact with the Office of Research
Services, such as grant application time. Thus all funded research
projects will have appropriate working and archive storage allocated
from the project start.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Reporting on published data collections<a href="#_ftn2"><span
class="MsoFootnoteReference"></span></a> will be aligned with
events such as grant-funded projects concluding.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h2>More about the repository software architecture</h2>
<p>A repository is not just a software application. It’s a lifestyle. It’s
not just for Christmas. And if you build it they almost certainly won’t
come. The main repository-like components of the RDR, the storage and
catalogue, will be loosely coupled, but there will need to be overall
repository governance in place to make sure that data is well looked
after. (We’re setting aside discussion of the computing component for
now, more on that soon.)</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/download3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>More detail about the RDR</p>
<p>To implement the Research Data Catalogue UWS will be using the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/redboxmint/">ReDBox
Research Data Catalogue
application</a> working
alongside a scalable storage system (we have a post about what kind of
storage and how it might be organised coming soon).</p>
<p>Above, we talked above about the need for systems that can describe
research data collections. In most organisations we don’t know what data
we have, because there is no catalogue or registry with metadata about
data collections sitting there ready to be aggregated. The ReDBox
application will fill this gap; it is the place where the library team
will work with researchers to describe their collections, check the
descriptions and finally publish them, with metadata that is as high in
quality as we can manage.</p>
<p>Some collection descriptions will come, at least in part, from data
capture software systems. It’s worth noting that many data capture
projects could be a lot more ephemeral than the repository. They could
be project based, or they could use software that does not have a long
working life, so one of the core assumptions we’ve made is that for many
data capture applications there will be a step when data crosses the
<a href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/september07/treloar/09treloar.html">curation
boundary</a>
into  the repository, where we know it will be looked after for the
appropriate length of time. Data may or may not be moved into the
storage component in the repository depending on a number of factors,
including its size, the nature of the data capture application and
whether it has the right governance in place to ensure that data can be
managed to the standards set for the RDR. There’s a lot more to say
about this interface, we’re preparing another post with a detail based
on a specific implementation being built by Intersect and UWS.</p>
<p>Open questions for the UWS deployment include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Will the catalogue itself be used for discovery or do we want to
publish information about research data holdings via some other
means, such as the VITAL-powered institutional repository, or via a
discovery layer service?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will we insist on a single RDR API to program against, or be more
relaxed about how various services talk to the storage, catalogue or
name authority service directly? At stake here is the integrity of
the contract with researchers and the world, the contract that the
catalogue matches what data we have.</p>
<p>Experience suggests that trying to make everything go through one
tiny little software keyhole won’t work. Governance is governance,
software that gets in the way gets routed-around, and it will take
<strong>people</strong> to honour the various contracts involved such as the one
that says once you assign a DOI (an ID, as seen in journal
publishing) to a data set you <strong>don’t change the data</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Opportunities for collaboration</h2>
<p>A number of Australian Universities have money under the ANDS Metadata
Stores funding stream for projects like the UWS Research Data Catalogue.
There will be lots of models for what a metadata store looks like, but
if we can find some common ground then we should be able to:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Form a consortium of some kind, of like-minded institutions, using
similar software componentry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work out which software, documentation, training course requirements
are shared across sites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pool some of our funding to develop the above.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Simple, apart from the complexities of legal contracts etc. But there
might be ways to divide up work, do it at different institutions and
contribute it back to the commons; all ANDS-funded software deliverables
are open source, and documentation etc can be made open access.</p>
<p>A good place to look for commonality is in the ANDS recommended
deliverables.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>D1</strong>   A working feed of records describing <em>Collections</em> and associated <em>Activities, Parties</em> and <em>Services</em> to <strong>Research Data Australia</strong>, in the current version of <strong>RIF-CS</strong> (1.3), demonstrated to meet the quality requirements for RIF-CS records as set by ANDS.
<strong>D2</strong>   A feed of collections from at least three distinct Faculties (or equivalent organisational units) within the institution to <strong>Research Data Australia</strong>.
<strong>D3</strong>   Demonstrated alignment of metadata records about <em>Parties</em> with an institutional name authority (HR or Library), with the authoritative form of the name sourced external to the metadata store, and with new researcher descriptions added to the metadata through regular updates from the name authority.
<strong>D4</strong>   Demonstrated alignment of metadata records about <em>Parties</em> with the ARDC Party Infrastructure Project, with researcher descriptions contributed to the <strong>NLA</strong>, and with People Australia identifiers for researchers recorded against researchers.
<strong>D5</strong>   Demonstrated alignment of metadata records about <em>Activities</em> with institutional and external sources of truth (<strong>Research Office</strong>, <strong>ARC</strong> and <strong>NHMRC</strong> grant registries), with the authoritative description of the <em>Activity</em> sourced external to the metadata store, and with new researcher project added to the metadata through regular updates from the sources of truth.
<strong>D6</strong>   Demonstrated workflow for registering new <em>Collections</em> in the university; this can include automated update, or semi-automated (notification-based).
<strong>D7</strong>   A software system to realise deliverables D1–D6 (and D8, D13–D14 if applicable), with robust storage and management of metadata.</p>
<hr>
<p>To summarise, a comment about these deliverables in the light of the
architecture sketched above. D6 is huge. “Demonstrated workflow for
registering new Collections in the university” Most of the other
deliverables are dealing with data that’s already well described, and
needs to be integrated into a metadata store. One could argue that we
could quite easily link a collection to a URL about a grant funded
project (there’s your activities taken care of), forget about describing
people at the national library or trying to set up yet another local ID,
and put resources into getting <a href="http://about.orcid.org/">ORCID up and
running</a>. But what about the all-important
collections? Isn’t that the whole point? Note to other Metadata Stores
project people: don’t forget, the workflow for ‘registering’ collections
presupposes that you have a way of describing the collections in the
first place, and making sure you can manage those collection
descriptions even if some of the more ephemeral data sources (such as
data capture projects) disappear.</p>

I’m speaking at one of those commercial conferences in Melbourne this
week, [Virtual Infrastructure & Research
Support](http://virtualedutech.com/agenda/) an honour gifted to me by
boss Professor Andrew Cheetham who couldn’t make it.
<p>There are three points they wanted me to speak about in a session about
Fostering Collaboration. When I decided to do this, I thought it would
be relatively easy, this is right up my alley. But as I started
preparing, I started telling myself a slightly different story that I
thought I would. So, here are my notes for tomorrow, complete with dodgy
embedded slides.</p>
<section itemscope itemtype="http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide">
## Fostering Collaboration across Institutions
<ul>
<li>
<p>Improving the collaborative capacity of research data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making data discoverable and connected</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Security and IP</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section>
When I started working on this talk, I thought I was going to talk about
data. I was going to talk about how to improve metadata, how to use a
linked data approach to make sure that all the names of things used in
metadata are unambiguous and Semantic Web Ready. But when I started
thinking about the work we’ve been doing at University of Western Sydney
on making data discoverable and connected – by managing it effectively –
it became clear that most of the work was on people-processes.
<p>Of course the technicalities are important and in some other contexts it
would be hard to stop me from going on about them but for this topic,
<em>fostering collaboration</em> I’m going to focus on the people and think
about how the systems and data serve the people.</p>
<section itemscope itemtype="http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide">
## Remember, data don’t collaborate…
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/wpid-collab-talk.docx.htm_collab-talk.docx_filesimage002.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>… people collaborate.</p>
</section>
These people are working together in a project to get the ball off the
dog.
<p>(Tip: Never mind cats, don’t ever try to herd someone who’s half sheep
dog)</p>

## There are two kinds of people
<ul>
<li>
<p>Researchers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And people who are here on earth to help them</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At UWS, we have <a href="http://eresearch.uws.edu.au/blog/2012/08/17/potential-research-data-repository-data-management-use-cases-for-discussion/">started mapping out these
relationships</a>
and there will be a lot more of this.</p>
</section>
I’d like to talk about collaboration as it relates to both of those
groups. They each have their own modes of collaboration. In this venue,
the expensive commercial conference, I was assuming that we are mostly
the latter kind of person. So, I will talk about “improving the
collaborative capacity of research data” but I also want to talk about
improving the collaborative capacity of *us*, and our capacity to
collaborate with our researchers.
<p>I have a lot of experience with collaborative projects both in the
Higher Education world, and in open source software. I’ll start with
some of the techniques that I have found to work. One of the basic
things is to pay attention to what’s working for other people, and not
just your immediate peers. The best people to watch are the ones who get
stuff done.</p>
<p>Q: Who knows best how to run huge collaborative knowledge management and
generation projects?</p>
<p>A: The people who built a substantial part of the Internet, the Linux
operating system and invented various kinds of ‘open’.</p>
<section itemscope itemtype="http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide">
## Watching the Alpha Geeks
<p>Tim O’Reilly <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/network/2002/04/09/future.html">said in
2002</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So often, signs of the future are all around us, but it isn't until
much later that most of the world realizes their significance.
Meanwhile, the innovators who are busy inventing that future live in a
world of their own. They see and act on premises not yet apparent to
others. In the computer industry, these are the folks I affectionately
call &quot;the alpha geeks,&quot; the hackers who have such mastery of their
tools that they &quot;roll their own&quot; when existing products don't give
them what they need.</p>
<p>The alpha geeks are often a few years ahead of their time. They see
the potential in existing technology, and push the envelope to get a
little (or a lot) more out of it than its original creators intended.
They are comfortable with new tools, and good at combining them to get
unexpected results.</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
More from Tim:
<blockquote>
<p>What we do at O'Reilly is watch these folks, learn from them, and try
to spread the word by writing down (or helping them write down) what
they've learned and then publishing it in books or online. We also
organize conferences and hackathons at which they can meet face to
face, and do advocacy to get wider notice for the most important and
most overlooked ideas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I started applying this back in 2006. The RUBRIC project was about
Regional Universities Building Research Infrastructure Collaboratively –
a circa $6M project from 2006-2009 to establish institutional
repositories in a variety of Australian and New Zealand universities. I
was the technical lead on the project, but the project manager went on
maternity leave very soon after the project started and I ended up as de
facto manager for a good while.</p>
<p>To help establish the collaboration between a dozen or so universities
and associated bodies such as the National Library and ARROW and APSR, I
tried setting up a project collaboration area using
<a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a>, which is a Free tool developed for
and by software developers. Trac has a wiki, and a ticket management
system, and was used to house the code that generated on the project. We
also used online bookmark manager Delicio.us to compile collaborative
lists of resources, Zotero for compiling a shared bibliography, held
phone based teleconferences and even had SharePoint available for those
who could bear it not to mention a static website.</p>
<p>We gave our cohort of between ten and twenty collaborators (it varied)
access to all these systems and let them use the bits that suited them.
Different sub-groups tended to hang out in different parts of the
system; most were exposed to new tools they could take away with them to
future endeavours, I know that members of the RUBRIC central team at
least took away knowledge of ‘alpha geek’ tools and attitudes that have
helped them since.</p>

</section>
We created a rich environment in which collaboration could take place,
then let people take the [desire
path](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire_path)s. Groups like mine work
in the gap between the concrete and the goat track, my job is to
encourage the goats.
<p>I learned a couple of things about building useful working relationships
in distributed teams.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Face to face day-long meetings with dinner the night before and a
decent hotel work better than tense teleconferences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subsequent teleconferences work well, but repeat (1) as needed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I asked Amanda Nixon, who is now my counterpart eResearch Manager at
Flinders in South Australia what she leaned from the RUBRIC project
about collaboration. She said that building interpersonal relationships
was important, not relationships based on roles.</p>

So much for collaboration in the people who help researchers, now lets
talk about researchers themselves. Last week I attended an Open Science
Meetup in Sydney, in a pub, where I finally met
Alpha-collaborative-chemist [Mat
Todd](http://sydney.edu.au/science/chemistry/research/todd.html). Mat
does Open Science, which means *everything* is in the open. As I said
before, collaboration is about people, not data, or things. Matt and his
colleagues recognize that the current process of doing long-cycle
science is broken, or at least is a horse-drawn coach in the age of the
rail-network.
<p>After talking with Mat, I out together a jocular ‘model’ of research
collaboration. This shows two researchers creating “science” by taking
turns to make parts of the whole. This is similar to something I put
together for my PhD that showed two people collaboratively creating T E
X T one letter at a time. While these simple diagrams might seem a bit
silly, in Systemic Linguistics in the early 90s there was an important
point to be made – all the models of collaboratively produced text were
expressed as flow-charts, that is they were synoptic rather than dynamic
models.</p>
<p>Point is, we need to be careful in modelling and thinking about
collaboration to make sure that we think in dynamic models that do take
into account the various participants and stakeholders.</p>

I asked Mat about how they deal with their data, is it well described,
do they have good metadata? The answer was, essentially; no, not really,
but we’re working on that. So then how does the collaboration work? Mat
told me that because everything is in the open, and deposited to their
online lab notebook, it is possible for anyone to join in at any time,
and they recruit people to their projects via social networks (even
LinkedIn! Who knew?), so if they need a particular kind of analysis done
they ask, others, people who were not known to the original researchers
can see in to the project, work out what needs to be done, and step in.
This short-cycle get-things-done science does result in publications,
too, but it is not held up by the need to publish an article over the
need to do *work*.

## An example of open science
<blockquote>
<p>In April 2010 a request was posted to a (closed, 2,500-member) process
chemistry networking
forum<a href="http://www.nature.com/nchem/journal/v3/n10/full/nchem.1149.html#ref12" title="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?mostPopular=&amp;gid=1061737">^12^</a><span
class="apple-converted-space"> </span>on LinkedIn for suggestions, but
also for people who might be willing to contribute more materially.
This stimulated 20 comments (from 11 different people) and four
private e-mails (via the website**). None of these contributors were
previously known to us.** From the advice and offers, we chose to send
one gram of racemic PZQamine to a Dutch contract research
organization, Syncom, which arrived in mid-May. On 25 May, the company
posted the identification of several chiral columns and conditions
that enabled the baseline separation of the PZQamine enantiomers,
permitting an assay for the effectiveness of any resolution attempts.
On 25 August the company posted a lead chiral acid that had been
identified (actually two months earlier) that effected the resolution
of PZQamine. <strong>The company was not paid for this work.</strong></p>

The Open Science crowd are showing us the future of research but many
others find themselves locked-in to a collaboration mechanism which was
optimal in the 17^th^ Century and has since evolved into an elaborate
mechanism for lining the pockets of a few multinational corporations, at
the expense of the research community and the broader community in which
they live.
<p>(Speaking of outmoded forms of communication, Mat also talked about the
value of traditional conferences – we don’t need them to communicate any
more, so why not use face to face time to focus on getting word done,
via workshop meetings that attack particular problems.)</p>
<p>In Australia, we’re now operating in a policy framework which is trying
to encourage re-use of data, and open publication, but we’re stuck on
hamster-wheel which is apparently hooked up to electrical generators
which keep the lights on at Elsevier.</p>
<p>Where can we look for hints about a way off the treadmill? Well, the
astronomy and physics communities have made trails. They have been
working in teams for years, they publish everything openly at
<a href="http://arxiv.org/">arxiv.org</a>, and being technical, tend to be able to
roll-their own tools.</p>

<p>The latest ANDS newsletter has a number of success stories about
data-driven collaboration. <a href="http://www.ands.org.au/newsletters/newsletter-2012-13.pdf">Read

It is possible that if we carefully label data, store it somewhere and
then advertise its existence via Research Data Australia, then people
will discover it. But, I suspect, most of the action will be within
communities and databases that are built for and by those communities,
like the LinkedIn community that Mat mentioned.
<section itemscope itemtype="http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide">
## Example from the ANDS newsletter
<h2>Repository of Antibiotic Resistance Cassettes</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The repository
(<a href="file:///%5Cvmware-host%5Cwww2.chi.unsw.edu.au%5C8080:rac">www2.chi.unsw.edu.au:8080/rac</a>)
allows researchers to submit data on potential cassettes online. This
information is reviewed by staff at the Centre for Infectious Diseases
and Microbiology, and any new cassettes are provided with accurate
names, archived and the knowledge made available. The database can
then be searched online and the cassettes annotated from anywhere in
the world. At present, it has regular users in 15 countries, though
primarily in Australia.</p>
</blockquote>

</section>
I had a look at the Repository of Antibiotic Resistance Cassettes site,
and it seems to offer what it says on the label, but I was not able to
find any of the data sets in RDA (I didn’t look that hard, they might be
there). But given that Researchers already have their own collaborative
networks, as Glenn Maloney reminded us on the first day of the
conference, this is probably not a problem.
<p>To understand what kinds of systems we need to support collaboration
around data reuse, we need to talk in detail to large numbers of
research cohorts in a wide variety of disciplines. I have started with
such project with researchers at the Hawkesbury Institute for the
Environment. At this stage I am working with climate modeller <a href="http://www.remkoduursma.com/">Remko
Duursma</a> on getting some examples of how
environmental data can be packaged for re-use, with complete provenance
to show how raw data is cleaned, filtered, fed to models, and used to
generate figures for research articles. Remko and I will broaden this
out to a wider range of participants once we get some initial
demonstrations sorted out.</p>
<p>We have to work out how to carve-up the continuous process that these
researchers go through of taking raw data, cleaning it up, using stuff
like “known good days” when the facility was known to be operating
correctly, using a reproducible well documented process, filtering that
data down to something useful and then running various processes over it
and publishing the results. What should be packaged together? What’s
useful for others? What’s dangerous to release on its own (like raw data
with known bad parts).</p>

I have talked elsewhere about what we’re doing in the Institutional Data
Repository projects in Australia [for example at Open
Repositories](http://ptsefton.com/2012/07/24/think-local-act-global-institutional-data-repositories-being-built-in-australia-with-lessons-learned-from-institutional-publications-repositories.htm)
in July. But here’s one slide that sums it up.
<section itemscope itemtype="http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide">
## Making data linkable – give everything a URI

</section>
Moving on to the last point. There are people here much better qualified
to talk about security than I am, so I’ll talk a little about “IP”.
<p>Actually, I do have this to say about security. Given the state of
infrastructure we have, data can be in one of two security states it’s
either open to all, or locked down so that only the repository admins
and the researcher can see it. More complex collaboration requires a
mature community with their own resources</p>

An image of<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>[Richard Matthew
Stallman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman "w:Richard Stallman")<span
class="apple-converted-space"> </span>taken from the cover of the
O'Reilly book<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>[w:Free as in
Freedom: Richard Stallman's Crusade for Free
Software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_as_in_Freedom:_Richard_Stallman%27s_Crusade_for_Free_Software "w:Free as in Freedom: Richard Stallman's Crusade for Free Software")<span
class="apple-converted-space"> </span>by Sam Williams, published on
March 1, 2002 under the GFDL.
<p>Richard Stallman was probably more concerned with capital-F Freedom than
with collaboration, but his insight that copyright could be turned 180°
created the conditions for a huge collaborative engineering effort to
create a vast free software stack created by O’Reilly’s alpha geeks.
Stallman’s insight was possible because he looked at the mechanism of
copyright, the legal framework, rather than the illusion of
“intellectual property”, the vague association of the properties of
physical property with a notional abstract virtual property.</p>
<section itemscope itemtype="http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide">
## Don’t talk about “owning” data
<p>Use language appropriate to the various kinds of intellectual property
that researchers are dealing with.</p>
<p>See: <a href="http://ptsefton.com/2012/03/02/did-you-say-you-%E2%80%9Cown%E2%80%9D-this-data-you-keep-using-that-word-i-do-not-think-it-means-what-you-think-it-means.htm">Did you say you “own” this data? You keep using that word. I do
not think it means what you think it
means.</a></p>
</section>
To wrap this up, I’ll reiterate that we need to think about scholarly
process and scholarly communications as a dynamic system, with multiple
participants. We can’t pull people out of the (front loading) scholarly
washing machine mid cycle, we need to consider where we can make small
changes, and choose a difference wash-cycle next time.

## Making data collaboration-ready?
<ul>
<li>
<p>The alpha-collaborators are telling us Remove all “IP” related
issues by using open licenses or go public-domain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If that’s not possible, seek tools that allow the right people to
work together.<br />
(Thanks NeCTAR with your cloud and labs and tools)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do data management well. Eg use linked-data approached to metadata.</p>
<p>(Sorry if you were expecting <em>that</em> talk, maybe next time)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And finally:</p>
<p>If in doubt and you need a collaboration tool: use a mailing list.</p>

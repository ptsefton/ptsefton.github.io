<h1> 
Open Repositories Developer Challenge. DRAFT manifesto v0.1 
</h1>
<h2>2012-09-05 </h2>

<article itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ScholarlyArticle">
I am on the committee for the Open Repositories conference. This year in
Edinburgh I chaired the judging panel for the “[Developer
Challenge](http://devcsi.ukoln.ac.uk/developer-challenges/developer-challenge-or-12/)”,
the development (or ideas) competition that runs inside the conference.
Over the years I’ve been in a number of these things as a contestant, a
judge, and last year one of the facilitators.
<p>NOTE: In this post I speak for myself, and not for the committee or for
JISC/<a href="http://devcsi.ukoln.ac.uk/">DevCSI</a> who run this challenge.</p>
<p>I think that the challenge is widely believed to be an important part of
the conference, and the live pitches (with beer for all) are valuable
and entertaining. But there’s always discussion about whether we’ve got
the mix right. Should people be writing code? Is it healthy for
developers to hang out in the developer lounge and miss papers? How can
repository managers get more involved? Is this a way to get cheap
development done on our repository platforms?</p>
<p>And there are issues about the makeup of the developer community. For
example this year’s winner Patrick McSweeney asked, how can we get more
women involved?</p>
<p>I think sometimes the answers are elusive because we don’t step back and
think about what we’re trying to achieve.</p>
<p>So, in the spirit of the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a>,
how does this <em>draft</em> sound?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We want to provide opportunities for growth for our software
developers and show our support and appreciation by providing them
with an event, the developer challenge, that is fulfilling for them
and also valuable for the Open Repositories community.<br>
Through this event we have come to value:</p>
<p><strong>Transparent, fun, open collaboration in diversely constituted
teams</strong> over individual brilliance and/or groups of like individuals
in cut-throat competition.</p>
<p><strong>The creation of new professional networks</strong> over the ossification of
old ones.</p>
<p><strong>Effective engagement of non-developers (researchers, repository
managers) in development</strong> over purely developer driven projects.</p>
<p><strong>Work done at the conference</strong> over presentation of something
prepared earlier.</p>
<p><strong>Innovative ideas expressed in running code</strong> over **** wireframes,
hand waving and elevator pitches.</p>
<p><strong>The development of the Open Repositories movement as a whole</strong> over
siloed development on particular repository platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Entertaining live presentation of challenge projects in a relaxed
setting</strong> over formal submissions.</p>
<p>That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the
items on the left more in the context of the developer challenge at
the Open Repositories conference.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paradoxically, while there is a competitive element to the challenge,
many of the values which I think really underpin  the challenge are
about collaboration over competition. In 2011, for example the winning
entry was a team formed from two separate teams who met in the lounge
and workshopped their ideas together. This was in line with the values I
suggest above, and was definitely taken into account in the judging. I
was not a judge but I was helping them<a href="#_ftn1"><span
class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span
class="MsoFootnoteReference">[1]</span></span></a>.</p>
<p>Like I said, this is a proposal only, I’m publishing this draft for
comment, and will be putting this to the Open Repositories committee, to
see if they like this approach. If we can agree on some values, then the
next step would be to structure the judging in order to maximise the
<em>value</em>.</p>
<p>These kinds of challenge/competition happen in other conferences in and
contexts, what do you all think?</p>
<hr>
<p><a href="#_ftnref1"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span
class="MsoFootnoteReference">[1]</span></span></a> Me, I’m
looking forward to the year <em>everyone</em> collaborates on one mega-entry
and splits the money</p>

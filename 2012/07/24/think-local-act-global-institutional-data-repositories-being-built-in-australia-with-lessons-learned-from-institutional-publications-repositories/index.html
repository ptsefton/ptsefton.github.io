<h1>Slide 2</h1>
<div>
<p>In this talk we're going to look at the change in architecture that
we're seeing as repositories mature and talk about the work that's going
on in Australia to build a new wave of Institutional data repositories.</p>
</div>

<h1>Slide 3</h1>
<div>
<p>We'll refer to the first wave of institutional repositories as &quot;IPRs&quot;
rather than just IRs - the P is for &quot;Publications&quot;. Many IPRS are almost
exclusively collections of PDF files. Digital versions of the stacks of
paper managed by the libraries that run the repositories. (This is the
local National Library).</p>

<h1>Slide 4</h1>
<div>
<p>Without wanting to sound too much like the Repository Rat, Dorothea Salo
and her 'roach motel ( “Innkeeper at the Roach Motel.” Library Trends
57, no. 2 (2008): 98–123.) ', the first IPRs could be characterised as
monolithic containers. You can put things in, and check them out, and
there is a batch download facility in the form of OAI-PMH. Of course
IPRs have moved on from the first self-deposit systems like ePrints a
decade ago.</p>

</section>
<section itemscope itemtype="http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide">
<h1>Slide 5</h1>
<div>
<p>IPRs have in many cases become sites for activities other than
deposit/retrieve, although there is now a big question mark over their
role in a potential new Open Access scholarly communications process. As
the landscape changes they will need to evolve, as libraries have done.
(Anna Shadbolt points out that there is a banner missing here on this
library: Win an IPad!)</p>

<h1>Slide 6</h1>
<div>
<p>Some important background: In Australia the government has invested in
research infrastructure. Earlier waves of cash gave us IPRs at every
institution. Now the push is to build IDRs where D is for data. Not
everyone talks about repositories in this space now though. Why? because
this time the money is split across multiple government funded projects
which are not 100% aligned: data storage is funded separately from data
registries/catalogue, so many have not conceptualised the infrastructure
as a repository with storage and catalogue services together.</p>
</div>

</section>
<section itemscope itemtype="http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide">
<h1>Slide 7</h1>
<div>
<p>One of the problems that we had with IPRs was that the local use of
metadata, particularly terms for things like subjects, and strings to
refer to people, was not standardised. The situation with metadata in
IPRs is rather like our multiple railway gauges nationally (we weren't
always one country and change is expensive if you try to do it too
late.) As we start to work on IDRs the Australian National Data Service
(one of the groups handing out cash) is trying to improve the way data
is described across all IDRs, to try to prevent too many problems down
the ‘track’.</p>

<h1>Slide 8</h1>
<div>
<p>When you're trying to build an aggregation service standardisation
becomes a problem. This is Research Data Australia, run by the
Australian National Data Service.
<a href="http://researchdata.ands.org.au">http://researchdata.ands.org.au/</a></p>

</section>
<section itemscope itemtype="http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide">
<h1>Slide 9</h1>
<div>
<p>Research Data Australia has a gatekeeper - participating organisations
submit sample records for approval before being allowed to join. The
process is not perfect, but it does mean there is a chance for both
local provider and global aggregator to collaborate and ANDS sponsor
conversations about metadata quality.</p>
</div>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/wpid-3a1a2286-d554-11e1-a227-60c54708f624.jpg" alt=""></p>
</section>
<section itemscope itemtype="http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide">
<h1>Slide 10</h1>
<div>
<p>ANDS is investing in projects to help work out a balance between local
needs and global demands for consistency in metadata - this is a complex
balancing act, ask for too much globally and you risk getting nothing.
For example a project at Griffith University where Natasha Simons blogs
about metadata issues. <a href="http://ands-gold-griffith.blogspot.com.au/">http://ands-gold-griffith.blogspot.com.au/</a></p>
</div>

</section>
<section itemscope itemtype="http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide">
<h1>Slide 11</h1>
<div>
<p>Back to architecture: the new wave of IDRs is architecturally very
different from the first wave of IPRs - we have learned to collaborate
better within our institutions, and look very carefully at other systems
for integration points. This diagram from the planning process for the
ReDBOX research data repository shows significant interaction between
the IDR and external systems at the university, including processes, not
just software.</p>
</div>

</section>
<section itemscope itemtype="http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide">
<h1>Slide 12</h1>
<div>
<p>This is a VIVO diagram. As we have widened our focus the diagrams get
more baroque - we don't recall such complex visions back in the days of
the first IPRs. Also, five years ago advice for repository managers did
not typically include having the chair of a repository steering group
being a Deputy or Pro-Vice Chancellor for research.</p>
</div>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/wpid-2cb818b4-d554-11e1-80c8-60c54708f624.jpg" alt=""></p>
</section>
<section itemscope itemtype="http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide">
<h1>Slide 13</h1>
<div>
<p>Another trend we are seeing is the use or URLs as names for things. Both
of the IDR applications we're discussing here today use a linked-data
approach - VIVO is aggressively linked-data because it is a semantic web
application built on RDF. ReDBOX is linked-data ready with more of a
philosophy of &quot;We'll add an RDF triple store when the first real user
turns up and asks for a SPARQL endpoint&quot;</p>

<h1>Slide 14</h1>
<div>
<p>Each of the repository solutions we're talking about here has a registry
or catalogue component which can be used to create different views of
the research life cycle for administrators, researchers, higher-degree
students and so. (c) Adam Hart-Davis used with permission</p>

</section>
<section itemscope itemtype="http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide">
<h1>Slide 15</h1>
<div>
<p>One of the other major trends we're seeing with data repositories is
automated deposit via &quot;Data Capture&quot; applications. Architectures vary
much more widely than in the IPR days, as the community find a balance
between mechanised harvesting and hand-crafting collections.</p>
</div>

</section>
<section itemscope itemtype="http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide">
<h1>Slide 16</h1>
<div>
<p>The data deluge is being channeled by using existing metadata and
processes to contain it - we have lots of research-process information
about grants, publications, people, groups, and can use this to classify
data as it rains down on us.</p>
</div>

</section>
<section itemscope itemtype="http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide">
<h1>Slide 17</h1>
<div>
<p>In addition to the aforementioned industrial harvesting of data and
automated metadata creation using contextual research information
systems, there is still a role for hand-crafted rich descriptive
metadata.</p>
</div>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/wpid-37966ea2-d554-11e1-9d0f-60c54708f624.jpg" alt=""></p>
</section>
<section itemscope itemtype="http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide">
<h1>Slide 18</h1>
<div>
<p>The semantic web approach of VIVO is allowing us to describe resources
ever more deeply, from metadata about scholarship to the actual
resources and products of scholarship using systems like eagle-I
<a href="https://www.eagle-i.net/">https://www.eagle-i.net/</a>.</p>

<p>Where to from here? More slow progress, more evolving along with
libraries and the scholarly process.</p>
</div>

<h1>Slide 20</h1>
<div>
<p>The future! May not be as neat as we'd planned, but likely to be more
connected. The new-wave of repository systems should be much better
networked than the first round of Institutional Publications
Repositories in the early to mid 2000s. We hope this means that IDRs can
play a lead role in the new networked scholarship that Cameron Neylon
talked about in his keynote at Open Repositories 2012

        CAIRSS – CAUL Australasian Institutional Repository Support Service 
        </h1>
        <h2>2013-01-31 </h2>

        <article>
<section>
By Dr Peter Sefton (University of Western Sydney) with Ms Caroline Drury
(University of Southern Queensland).
<p>On Wednesday 5^th^ Dec I (Peter) visited the Japanese Digital Repository
Federation at their invitation and expense, to talk about how our
respective repository communities are organised.  I’d like to thank the
DRF for this opportunity to make the brief trip to Tokyo. Caroline was
invited but was unable to make it. The DRF folks have put up a <a href="http://drf.lib.hokudai.ac.jp/drf/index.php?DRF%20CAIRSS%20meeting">summary
of the
meeting</a>,
in Japanese. Note that while my comments on that page are listed as
“CAIRSS” I was not representing CAIRSS (the CAUL (Council of Australian
University Librarians) Institutional Repository Support Service), I
attended as a member of the Australian/Australasian repository
community. I also attended the DRF international conference in 2009 on a
similar basis, when I did happen to be associated with CAIRSS, so the
organisers knew me. I did talk a fair bit about CAIRSS, in the context
of other projects in Australia.</p>
<p>Before I went I polled the CAIRSS-list to find out if there were any
questions people would like answered – more on that below.</p>
<p>First, a bit about me and repositories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I was the technical lead for the Regional Universities Building
Research Infrastructure Collaboratively
(<a href="http://rubric.edu.au">RUBRIC</a>) project which was hosted by the
University of Southern Queensland (and the de-facto project manager
for several months during the project establishment phase).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I led a small team at USQ subcontracting to the ARROW project during
2008, providing technical support to ARROW, and repository services
to small Higher Education institutions in Australia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I worked on USQ’s successful bid to host the first CAIRSS repository
support service in Australia and acted as a senior strategist for
the service, for example working on guides such as the one on <a href="http://cairss.caul.edu.au/cairss/repository-manager-tools/getting-into-google-google-scholar-and-other-search-engines/">how
to get into Google Scholar et
al</a>,
and negotiating major changes to repository infrastructure such as
the closure of the Australian Digital Theses search service and its
subsumption into the National Library of Australia’s Trove service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was <strong>not</strong> involved in running the second version of CAIRSS from
2011-2012 but I have remained part of the repository community in
Australia and attended the 2012 community day where I spoke about
<a href="http://ptsefton.com/2012/11/19/receding-repository-software.htm">trends in repository software in the context of organisational
governance</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am on the conference committee for the Open Repositories series of
conferences (from 2011) – the <a href="http://or2013.net/content/call-proposals">call for papers for the 2013
conference is just out</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<section>
<h2>The DRF</h2>
<p>Shigeki SUGITA started off proceedings with a <a href="http://drf.lib.hokudai.ac.jp/drf/index.php?plugin=attach&amp;pcmd=open&amp;file=ActivitiesOfDigitalRepositoryFederation.pdf&amp;refer=DRF%20CAIRSS%20meeting">presentation about the
activities of the Digital Repository
Federation</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most striking thing from an Australasian point of view is a
staffing issue; talented repository managers are required by management
to rotate through a variety of library jobs meaning that there is
constant turnover and a lack of opportunity to specialise. There are
similar pressures at play in our libraries I guess, with a need to train
new repository staff, and significant turnover but not to the same
extent.</p>
<p>Japanese repositories are very much driven by an Open Access agenda,
which is quite different from the situation in Australia where two
different government measurement schemes collecting information about
publications and push repositories in another direction, more on that
below.</p>
<p>Another interesting dimension to the Japanese scene is that they have a
number of consortial-repositories where a number of institutions share a
repository. This is an idea that came up in Australia in the mid-to-late
00’s several times, but never got off the ground. It might be worth
revisiting some time both for institutional publications repositories</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>The presentation</h2>
<p>I presented from an earlier version of the ‘slides’ below – I have added
some notes from the discussion and clarifying material.</p>
<section>
<h3>CAIRSS background</h3>
<section typeof="http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide">
<h4>Parent projects</h4>
<p>The Australian government made significant investments in institutional
repositories via programs such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://apsr.anu.edu.au/">APSR</a> Australian Partnership for
Sustainable Repositories (ended 2008)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://arrow.edu.au/">ARROW</a> Australian Research Repositories
Online to the World</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://rubric.edu.au/">RUBRIC</a>, Regional Universities Building
Repository Infrastructure Collaboratively.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section>
These projects and other investments in the repository world were via
these funding streams (for which the websites have disappeared):
<ul>
<li>
<p>ASHER2 – Australian Scheme for Higher Education Repositories
[Sponsored the development of repositories in all Higher Education
Institutions in Australia]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_Infrastructure_Initiative">SII3</a>
– Systemic Infrastructure Initiative [APSR, ARROW and RUBRIC]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backing_Australia%27s_Ability">BAA4</a> –
Backing Australia's Ability</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We talked in some detail about how these funding schemes have influenced
the establishment of repositories; while the initial driver for
Australian repositories was open access, the Excellence in Research for
Australia
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excellence_in_Research_for_Australia">ERA</a>)
measurement exercise and its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Quality_Framework">failed
predecessor</a>
stalled the Open Access movement to some extent, by requiring
universities to collect non-open access materials in complicated ways.</p>
<section typeof="http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide">
<h4>CAIRSS v1 2009-2011</h4>
<p>Coming out of the investments outline above, CAIRSS was established on
 March 16, 2009:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first CAUL service was funded for two years, with the approval of
Department of Innovation (DIISR), with monies remaining from the
successful ARROW project, supplemented by CAUL member subscriptions.</p>

<section typeof="http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide">
<h4>With added New Zealanders</h4>
<p>The second version of CAIRSS was funded from member subscriptions and
expanded to include New Zealand:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The second CAUL service is also funded for almost two years and
incorporates many of New Zealand’s higher education institutions. With
this expansion, CAIRSS now stands for the CAUL Australasian
Institutional Repository Support Service.</p>

<h2>Post CAIRSS: CRAC 2013-?</h2>
<p>From 2013 CAIRSS will no longer exist – it is being replaced with a new
service know as CRAC.  I gather that the feeling of CAUL was that the
community is now mature enough to be self-sustaining.</p>

<h4>New Open Access group: AOASG</h4>
<p>There is a new Open Access group in Australia which is not part of the
CAUL/CAIRSS family.</p>
<p>From Danny Kingsley:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Australian Open Access Support Group (AOASG) was launched during
Open Access Week in 2012. It is a consortium of six universities with
open access policies  - QUT, ANU, Macquarie University, Newcastle
University, Charles Sturt University and Victoria University. The
group aims to provide support, lobbying and advocacy for open access
in Australia. Membership will be extended to other research
institutions and affiliates during 2013.</p>

<h3>General comments about the CAIRSS/CRAC community</h3>
<section>
<h4>Small task-force groups now self-organize</h4>
<p>The repository community is well established and members of the
community run their own investigations into repository matters. These
range from asking questions on the list about repository practices, to
running formal surveys. An example from the broader CAUL community of
which CAIRSS is a part is the IR / Open Access Funding Survey by Danny
Kingsley and Vicki Picasso.</p>

<h3>Opportunities</h3>
<section typeof="http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide">
<h4>DRF collaboration?</h4>
<p>From Caroline Drury:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It would be interesting for CRAC to consider something similar to the
DRF model  - eg at the beginning of each two year period, to meet and
consider what projects could be done in the space, within Australia /
NZ. Then perhaps a call could be put to institutions who could then
(according to their strengths) be assigned to do that project in a
collaborative model, using their own funds. I’m not sure if it would
work here, given the big physical distances, but I think it's a good
model in a scenario where there's limited funding.</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
I’m sure CRAC will consider this.
<section typeof="http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide">
<h4>April event in Tasmania</h4>
<p>An event is being organised in Tasmania in April around the following
themes. Regional participating would be most welcome.</p>
<p>From David Flanders at ANDS:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>linking research data and research publications</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>re-architecting the repository (if we started now based on what we
know).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>business metrics/analytics from scholarly systems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>research profiles and author identifiers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>emerging scholarly vocabularies, linkeddata &amp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>scholarly search engines (beyond Google Scholar)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>APIs and bringing all these systems together via shared resources.</p>

<h2>Questions (with my notes)</h2>
<p>Natasha Simons at Griffith University had three questions that provided
a great structure for the discussion part of the meeting. I tried to
take notes (included below) as well as talk.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>\</p>
<ol>
<li>How's the Memorandum of Understanding between<span
class="apple-converted-space"> </span>Digital Repository Federation
(Japan), UKCoRR<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>and the UK
RSP going? What sorts of things are of the most importance to all
parties to share and experience in this space? What sort of
involvement has there been between the signers to the MoU? How do they
envisage this MoU benefiting all parties (particularly long-term)?\</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>In January 2012 – DRF heard there were repo managers in the UK, they
invited a rep from <a href="http://www.rsp.ac.uk/">Repositories Support
Project</a> (RSP) in the UK.  Jackie Whickam
came to snowy Hokkaido, where they found out that RDF and RSP
carried out similar activities – eg the re-enactment of online
discussions wearing masks.  After the meeting found out that there
were many more things to share. Eg in the UK they carry out
residential workshops. Meeting with JW was about operational things
between repo manager communities in UK and JP. Wanted to do more on
activities to do with individual repositories.</p>
<p>Most important objective of
<a href="http://rspproject.wordpress.com/2012/03/13/japan-and-uk-in-agreement/">MoU</a>
is to send representatives to counterpart meeting to share more
specifics. Since signed the MoU they have not done so much. First
thing was to invite a rep from UK to national workshop. UK rep was
asked to give a presentation about how they promote activities
inside universities.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The MoU says they will sponsor trips for each other (but the Brits
have not done their bit … yet :). RSP has just come to the end of
its funding cycle. DRF hopes that even though there is uncertainly
about funding the collaboration can continue. Funding is restricted
to long term planning is difficult.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br>
2. Find out what you can about the NII Repositories Program -<span
class="apple-converted-space"> </span><span
class="MsoHyperlink">http://www.nii.ac.jp/irp/en/rfp/</span><span
class="apple-converted-space"> </span><br>
There are some interesting projects listed. How do they decide on the
project areas? Where does the funding come from? How do they decide on
the actual projects? Are they all 12 month projects? Are they all
collaborative? How do they share the results?\</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cyber Science Infrastrcuture CSI hosted by NII – has a selection
board, informatics scholars &amp; heads / top management of uni
libraries about 10 members. 200 – 300 M Yen</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Launch – circa 50 univerisites circa 1M Yen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>R&amp; D (5-6 page proposal docs by multiple unis) - examples</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>DRF (proposal by several unis)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sherpa Romeo – Japan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Statistics</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>About 30 submitted – 20 accepted.</p>
<p>Proposals ask for money never given more, usually slightly less than
proposed. Money goes to the unis as project operators. Budgets split
between the participants (training, workshops, system development,
etc). Budget allocated on fiscal year basis, CSI checks. Proposal
made around March – decision around June – activities take place
from June to March. Following June there is a results project
meeting in Tokyo – 2 day meeting (decreasing because the number of
people launching has dropped. Initial 50 now 10).</p>
<p>Sharing of results at June meeting, not much more than that.  Some
projects with strong outreach will be well known. Out of 20 – some
projects faded out without much impact.</p>
<p>Some projects that have done well:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>DRF – The Digital Repositories Federation, my hosts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sherpa-Romeo Japan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SCPJ – Society Copyright Policy in Japan – 600 societies almost
all grey lit – a few are ‘green’
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access">OA</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ROAT – project to standardise repo stats same as PIRUS/IRUS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Author – ID – (ORCID) participants on this are involved in
ORCID. NII working on a trial basis to have a database of
Japanese researchers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>
<p>ShareRe – consortial repositories came out of Hiroshima . DSpace
commonly used in Japan and EARMAS (original Japanese repository
software)</p>
<p>There are 14 on a regional basis. Each one has a lead university
acts as a host to provide system and support.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hiroshima .  Collect funds for future 14 members. 14 * 13K
– 420K per kept in reserve, and used for security
maintenance. Operated by regional council of libraries,
Hiroshima uni serves as sectretariat and hosts, additional
funding come from regional 30K Yen per year. Initial launch
funds came from CSI – Hiroshima was the first.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>7 Member universities Kagoshima as lead. Initial investment
about 2M yen do not collect funds for future rennocation
collectively 250 K pro rata per year contributed by member
according to FTE</p>

<li>
<p>UsrCom – Trial repository system sandbox  - 2008-2009</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><br>
3. Are they ways we can communicate better with them? Do they hold
any webinars on topics that would be of interest to us? If so, how do
they tell people about them? Could they tell us? I see they post to
the JISC list every now and then (usually well-deserved achievement
boasts). Should we have a 'guest' from DRF join our CAIRSS e-list or
could they email you and then you post to our e-list?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don’t do webinars and they do everything in Japanese so that’s a
challenge. Does anyone on the CAIRSS list have good Japanese? The
DRF would like to have a member on the CAIRSS/CRAC list.</p>
<p>Future of DRF not clear.</p>
<p>(In Japan moves afoot to subsidise societies as a way of driving OA)</p>
<p>NO OA mandates from JP govt – rules being revised now so that theses
can go through IR or must? Policy reads like must but we don’t know.
May open the door for theses to publicised thru network. If this is
realised there will be more possibilities – need to think about
metadata standards and talking to national library. )</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<section>
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>Once again, thanks to the DRF for having me – I am following up with
CAUL on how we might be able to collaborate further. Now that we are in
the CRAC era, Caroline’s suggestion of having a ‘call for projects’ that
then get implemented at the member institutions sounds like it might be
a way forward, and an ongoing relationship with the DRF (and the UK RSP)
would be helpful, as they’ve been down this road before.</p>

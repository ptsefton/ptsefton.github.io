<section>
Steven Hayes from Arts eResearch at the University of Sydney invited me
to visit their group and talk about running open source software
projects, as they are making their
[Heurist](http://heuristscholar.org/heurist/help/tour.html) (semantic
database-of-everything) software open source. This was more of a
conversation than a presentation, but I prepared a few ‘slides’ to
remind me of which points to hit. Here are my notes. The focus here was
not on why go open source, or open source in general, it was about doing
it in a small university-based team. Comments about how various uni open
source projects run would be appreciated.
<p>I have been involved in creating two sizeable code-bases both released
by the University of Southern Queensland as open source. They had very
different histories. I’ll talk about both and how they run, although
actually one of them doesn’t run any more in any meaningful way.</p>
<section typeof="http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide">
## Two projects I started…
<p>… on which other people* did most of the work</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://code.google.com/p/integrated-content-environment/">ICE</a> –
the Integrated Content Environment. Used at USQ for creating course
materials for delivery online and in print. Almost no activity on
this outside of USQ these days. Inside USQ? I don’t know for
certain, but I think it is still in use, and finding a replacement
has proven difficult, which doesn’t surprise me as that was the
reason we built it in the first place).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.redboxresearchdata.com.au/">ReDBOX</a> – the Research Data
Box (and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/fascinatorhome/">The
Fascinator</a>, the
underlying toolkit).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section>
\*Thanks to Ron Ward, Oliver Lucido, Linda Octalina, Duncan Dickinson,
Greg Pendlebury, Daniel de Byl, Bron Chandler, Tim McCallum, Cynthia
Wong, Jason Zejfert, Sally MacFarlane, Caroline Drury, Pamela Glossop,
Warwick Milne, Sue Craig, Vicki Picasso, Dave Huthnance, Shirley Reushle
and the late Alan Smith who made, tested, championed and supported these
projects. Thanks also to funding from the Australian government via
ANDS, ARROW and other streams. Sorry if I forgot anyone.
<p>(At this point I wanted to check that everyone knows what Open Source
means, making sure that we all understand how Richard Stallman made
software free using copyright law. Whoever holds the copyright in a bit
of software, which is likely to be whoever wrote it, or their employer
can control distribution by using a licence, a legal instrument.
Stallman’s insight was that a licence could be used to enforce sharing,
openness and freedom: you can use this stuff I created provided you
promise to share it with other people (that’s not a quote). Oh, and
people working in this space should also understand the difference
between <a href="http://producingoss.com/en/producingoss.html#free-vs-open-source">Free and Open
Source</a>

## But I don’t like this
<p>The book begins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most free software projects <strong>fail</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think that’s silly, talking about failure without first defining
success.</p>
</section>
Me, I’m not sure that all these scenarios Fogel lists are failures at
all, there are lots of reasons to release code and they are not all
necessarily about building a substantial community:
<blockquote>
<p>We tend not to hear very much about the failures. Only successful
projects attract attention, and there are so many free software
projects in
total^[^<a name="idp5223728"></a><a href="http://producingoss.com/en/producingoss.html#ftn.idp5223728">^2^</a>^]^<span
class="apple-converted-space"> </span>that even though only a small
percentage succeed, the result is still a lot of visible projects. We
also don't hear about the failures because failure is not an event.
There is no single moment when a project ceases to be viable; people
just sort of drift away and stop working on it. There may be a moment
when a final change is made to the project, but those who made it
usually didn't know at the time that it was the last one. There is not
even a clear definition of when a project is expired. Is it when it
hasn't been actively worked on for six months? When its user base
stops growing, without having exceeded the developer base? What if the
developers of one project abandon it because they realized they were
duplicating the work of another—and what if they join that other
project, then expand it to include much of their earlier effort? Did
the first project end, or just change homes?</p>

<p>Figure 1 Me (the good looking one) and cousin Tim at the Springwood
Sports club, about to perform with a community uke-group. No plans for
world-domination, playing for family, who are obliged to attend and even
some people who , for some reason, <em>choose</em> to come. #Notfailure.</p>
</section>
<p>It’s important to work out why you are going to release software as Open
Source – think about the audience. One very important audience is you,
yourself. If you work on code as part of your job, then your employment
contract may well mean that your employer owns the copyright. Do you
want to be able to continue using it in your next job? Show potential
employers? Making it open source helps your future self.</p>
<p>I know this first hand.</p>
<p>Universities are not as stable as they seem, or you may hope. At the
Australian Digital Futures Institute at USQ we began by hosting code
repositories and websites internally. I reasoned that the university
would be a good bet for maintaining persistence of these resources.</p>
<p>But then one <a href="http://www.swinburne.edu.au/hed/pvc_learn_transform/gillysalmon.html">Gilly
Salmon</a>
came to our institute to be the new professor, decided, along with the
rest of the senior leadership team that there was altogether too much
<em>making</em> the digital future going on in the Australian Digital Futures
Institute, too much <em>technology</em>. They let just about all the technical
staff go, no matter how useful they were to the organisation, or how
pregnant they happened to be (we’re a relationship brand, the director
of marketing told me, so we shouldn’t be continuing to develop software
to deliver award-winning distance-ed services).</p>
<p>Web sites that would still have value are just gone from public view,
including, ironically the PILIN project site, which was about persistent
identifiers. Even the ICE website which is full of useful stuff for USQ
itself now appears to be <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120829154125/http://ice.usq.edu.au/">only accessible via the Wayback
machine</a>.
They’re still <em>using</em> it but they turned off the website anyway, the
code, however, is sitting on Google code so we all still have access to
it.</p>
<p>This sort of thing happens all the time. For a couple of us, the
<a href="http://www.virtualcampuses.eu/index.php/NextEd">NextEd</a> refugees, this
was the second redundancy associated with USQ. Kids, it is prudent to
make sure that any code you might want to re-use later in your career is
released under an open licence, and documentation, web sites etc
likewise under creative commons. Think of it as a professional escape
pod.</p>
<p>The ReDBOX project survived this ADFI shut down, because it had been
open source from the beginning but further funding had to be redirected
to another university which was willing to host the building of a
digital future.</p>
<section typeof="http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide">
## Lessons
<ul>
<li>
<p>Open Source can be worth doing even if the audience is your future
self</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t trust someone else to keep your website up</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want a community you’ll (likely) have to build it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every project is different, so you need to structure yours around
your users</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section>
Oh, and the answer to most questions is on Stack Exchange. I decided
that this list was worth using as a starting point for discussion.

## [Havoc P said](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/51553/checklist-for-starting-an-open-source-project): [with additions by me post the discussion at USYD]
<blockquote>
<p>Things I'd put in the early priorities are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>have a simple &quot;what is it?&quot; web site with links to some discussion
forum (whether email or chat) and to the source code repository</p>
<p><strong>[Mailing lists are usually best IMO – forums can be empty,
echoing and make you project look unloved. A tech list is a must,
always, but other communications should be built around the
reality of your project. No user community yet? Build one. Others
over at Stack Exchange added that once you have a tech-list is
best to hold or log all your discussions there so architectural
decisions are transparent and the community can engage.</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the ReDBOX project there are two main mailing lists, one for
the techies and one for the users (mostly library staff), and lots
of virtual and face-to-face get togethers. There is a committers
group who are in charge of what gets into the trunk and various
ad-hoc arrangements to sponsor sub-projects at the dozen or so
sites using the software. The groups and how they interact were
all created to serve that community, not from some manual of best
practice, although it is all informed by collective experience of
open source projects.]</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be sure the code compiles and usually works, don't commit
work-in-progress or half-ass patches on the main branch that break
things, because then other people's work would be disrupted</p>
<p><strong>[Well, OK, but if you’re releasing an existing code base then
don’t get too hung up on making things perfect (a) it will be a
huge waste if there is no demand for your code and (b) don’t be
unnecessarily shy, most open source projects are like busking, not
stadium rock, nobody is watching you waiting to pounce on your
errors.]</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>put a license file in the code repository with a well-known
license, and mark the copyright owner (probably you, or your
company). don't omit the license, make up a license, or use an
obscure license.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have instructions for how to contribute, say in a HACKING file or
include in your README. This should include where to send patches,
how to format patches, code indentation rules, any other important
conventions of the project</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have instructions on how to report a bug</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be helpful on the mailing list or whatever your forums are</p>
</li>
</ul>

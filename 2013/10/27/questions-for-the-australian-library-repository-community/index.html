<h1> 
Questions for the Australian (library) Repository Community 
</h1>
<h2>2013-10-27 </h2>

<p>I am at the CAUL Repository Community Days
<a href="http://www.caul.edu.au/content/upload/files/meetings/repositorycommunity2013.pdf">meeting</a>,
and along with a few other Antipodeans will he giving an update on the
<a href="http://or2013.net/">Open Repositories 2013 conference</a>. I gave a report
in <a href="http://ptsefton.com/2013/08/27/trip-report-open-repositories-2013.htm">a previous
post</a>,
but I thought I'd do another summary with the benefit of a couple more
months of hindsight, and ask a couple of questions of the Australian
Repo community. Comments are open!</p>
<h1>Reproducibility, reuse and friends</h1>
<p>As Rick Jelliffe <a href="http://ptsefton.com/2013/08/27/trip-report-open-repositories-2013.htm#comment-1027605700%5D">commented on my
post</a>
we need to get stuff happening, rather than making excuses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For controversial research, I think we have passed the point where
&quot;Use, Reuse, Reproduce is worthy, but I think maybe we're not there
yet&quot; is politically viable, however true it may be.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what are we (the library community) going to do to help?</p>
<h1>What's our 'Developer Challenge'?</h1>
<p>The developer challenge event needs looking after. In the years that we
could rely on JISC to show up to Open Repositories with facilitators
like David 'Flanders' Flanders or Mahendra Mahey and journalists to
document stuff things went pretty well, but this year JISC were not in a
position to put in so many resources, many developers developers
apparently didn't make the trip and things were a little more low-key.
So, the conference committee has decided to get serious about, there is
now officially a &quot;Developer Track&quot; with a &quot;Developer Track Chair&quot;. Guess
who that is.</p>
<p>And where where the Aussie and Kiwi developers? In
<a href="http://or08.ecs.soton.ac.uk/">2008</a> in Southampton there were enough of
us to make four-persong developer challenge entry with some left over,
this year I had to beg the only other developer from our part of the
world, Andrea Schweer (NZ) to enter the dev competition, which she did,
and managed to produce something useful for the community.</p>
<p>But never mind Canada, where are the developers back home? In many cases
they are no longer in the library, helping with the repository. And
there is no more CAIRSS repository support service and no more CAIRSS
technical officer. So how is the library, as custodian of the
Publication Repository and (maybe) the Data Repository for the institute
going to do what needs to be done as we reinvent the scholarly process?</p>
<p>Is our &quot;Developer Challenge&quot; getting access to developers in the first
place?</p>

<p>ABSTRACT</p>
<p>In this paper we look at current options available for storing research
data to maximize potential reuse and discoverability, both at the level
of data files, and sets of data files, and describe some original work
bringing together existing standards and metadata schemas to make
well-described, reusable data sets that can be distributed as single
files, dubbed “crates” with as much context and provenance as possible.
We look at some of the issues in choosing file formats in which to
archive and disseminate data, and discuss techniques for adding
contextual information which is both human-readable and machine-readable
in the context of both institutional and discipline data management
practice.</p>

<p>When the eResearch team at UWS and Intersect were working on the ANDS
DC21 “HIEv” (5) application to allow researchers to create data-sets
from collections of files, we looked in vain for a simple-to-implement
solution for making CSV-type data available with as much provenance and
re-use metadata as possible. In this presentation we will discuss some
of the many file-packaging options which were considered and rejected
including METS (6), and plain-old zip files with no metadata.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Eucalyptus woodland free-air CO2 enrichment (EucFACE) facility is
the only one of its kind in the southern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is unique in that it provides full-height access to the mature
trees within remnant Cumberland Plain Forest, the only FACE system in
native forest anywhere in the world. It is sited on naturally
low-nutrient soils in what is close to original bushland, and offers
researchers an amazing site at which to study the effects of elevated
CO2 on water use, plant growth, soil processes and native biodiversity
in a mature, established woodland within the Sydney Basin.</p>

<details open="open">
<p>We have reached the time when there is a genuine need to be able to
match-up data from different sources; infrastructure projects funded by
the Australian National Data Service (ANDS) (4) are now feeding
human-readable metadata descriptions to the<a href="http://researchdata.ands.org.au/"><u> Research Data
Australia</u></a> (RDA) website. But
which standards to use? As Tanenbaum said, “The nice thing about
standards is that you have so many to choose from. Furthermore, if you
do not like any of them, you can just wait for next year's model” (1).
However, when it comes to choosing file format standards for research
data, we have found that while there might be many standards there is no
single standard for general-purpose research data packaging. It is,
however possible to stitch-together a number of different standards to
do a reasonable job of packaging and describing research data for
archiving and reuse.</p>
<p>There are several issues with standards at the file level. For example
consider one of the most commonly supported formats: CSV – or Comma
Separated Values. CSV file is actually a non-standard, ie there is no
agreed CSV specification, only a set of unreliable conventions used by
different software,<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180"><u> RFC
4180</u></a> (2) notwithstanding. While
a CSV file has column headers, there is no way to standardise their
meaning. Moving up the complexity chain, the Microsoft Excel based .xslx
format is a standard, as is the Open Document Format for spreadsheets
but again, even though you can point to a header-row in a spreadsheet
and say “that’s the header” there is no standard way to label variables
in a way that will match with the labels used by other researchers, or
to allow discovery of the same kind of data points in hetrogenous data
sets. There is a well established standard which does allow for
“self-describing, machine-independent data formats that support the
creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data”, NetCDF
(3) – we will consider how this might be more broadly adopted in
eResearch contexts.</p>

proof-of-concept specification, known as a ‘crate’, based on a number of
standards,. This format:</p>
<p>Uses the California Digital Libraries Bagit specification(7) for
bundling files together into a bag.</p>
<p>Creates a single-file for the bag using zip (other contenders would
include TAR or disk image formats but zip is widely supported across
operating systems and software libraries).</p>
<p>Uses a human-readable HTML README file to make apparent as much metadata
as is available from (a) within files and (b) about the context of the
research data.</p>
<p>Uses RDF with the W3C’s DCAT ontology (8) and others to add machine
readable metadata about the package including relationships between
files, technical metadata such as types and sizes and research context</p>

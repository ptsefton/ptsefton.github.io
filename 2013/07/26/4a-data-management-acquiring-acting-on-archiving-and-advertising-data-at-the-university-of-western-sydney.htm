## Notes
<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>There has been significant Government investment in Australia in
repository and eResearch infrastructure over the last several years, to
provide all universities with an institutional repository for
publications, and via the Australian National Data Service to encourage
the creation of institution-wide Research Data Catalogues, and research
Data Capture applications. Further rounds of funding have added physical
data storage and cloud computing services. This presentation looks at an
example of how these streams of money have been channeled together at
the University of Western Sydney to create a joined-up vision for
research data management across the institution and beyond, creating an
environment where data may be used by research teams within and outside
of the institution. Alongside of the technical services, we report on
early work with researchers to create a culture of replicable use of
data, towards the vision of truly reproducible research.</p>
<p>This presentation will show a proven end-to-end design for research data
flows, starting from a research group, The Hawkesbury Institute for the
Environment, where a large sensor network gathers data for use by
institute researchers, in-situ, with data flowing-through to an
institutional data repository and catalogue, and thence to Research Data
Australia - a national data search engine. We also discuss a parallel
workflow with a more generic focus - available to any researcher. We
also report on work we have done to improve metadata capture at source,
and to create infrastructure that will support the entire research data
lifecycle. We include demonstrations of two innovations which have
emerged from the associated project work: the first is of a new tool for
researchers to find, organize, package and publish datasets; the second
is of a new packaging format which has both human-readable and
machine-readable components.</p>

</section>
<section>
## Notes
<p>We'll use the four A's to talk about some issues in data management.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We need a simple framework which covers it all, to capture how we
work with research data from cradle to grave:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need to Acquire the raw data and make it secure and available to
be worked on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need to Act on the data to cleanse it while keeping track of how
it was cleansed, analyse it using tools to support our research,
while maintaining the data's provenence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need to Archive the data from working storage to an archival
store, making it citable</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need to Advertise that the data exists so that others can
discover it and use it confidently with simple access mechanisms and
simple tools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4A must work for</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>high-intensity research data such as that from gene sequences,
sensor networks, astronomy, medical diagnostic equipment, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the long tail of unstructured research data.</p>

## Notes
<p>In the presentation, I used a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P1vf_7DoLA">short video on how to catch a
kangaroo</a>. (Late the night
before I was searching for this video and I forgot how spell kagaroo and
tried starting it like this “How to catch a C … A ... N ...” - at which
point the Google suggestion popped up with <a href="http://bitsandpieces.us/2013/03/22/how-to-catch-a-canadian/">this, which I decided not to
show at the
conference</a>
I'd blame the jet-lag, but you wouldn't believe me.)</p>
<p>If only data capture were as simple as catching a kangaroo in a shopping
bag!</p>

<section>
## Notes
<p>At UWS, we haven't tried to drive change with top-down policy. Instead,
we've taken a practical, project-based approach which has allowed a data
architecture to evolve. The <a href="http://eresearch.uws.edu.au/blog/roadmap/"><u>eResearch
Roadmap</u></a> calls for a
series of data capture applications to be developed for data-intensive
research, along with a generic application to cover the long tail of
research data.</p>
<section>
#### The 4A Vision
<p>For the purposes of this presentation we will talk about the ‘4A’
approach to research data management - Acquire, Act, Archive and
Advertise. The choice of different terms from the 2Rs Reuse and
Reproduce of the conference theme is intended to throw a slightly
different light on the same set of issues. The presentation will examine
each of these ‘A’s in turn and explain how they have helped us to
organize our thinking in developing a target technical data architecture
and integrated data-related end-to-end business processes and services
involving research technicians and support staff, researchers and their
collaborators, library staff, information technology staff, office of
research services, and external service providers such as the Australian
National Data Service and the National Library of Australia. The
presentation will also discuss how all of this relates to the research
project life cycle and grant funding approval.</p>
</section>
<section>
#### Acquiring the data
<p>We are attacking data acquisition (known as Data Capture by the
Australian National Data Service, ANDS 1) in two ways:</p>
<p>With discipline specific applications for key research groups. A number
of these have been developed in Australia recently (for example MyTARDIS
2), we will talk about one developed at UWS. With ANDS funding, UWS is
building an open source automated research data capture system (the
HIEv) for the Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment to automatically
gather time-series sensor data and other data from a number of field
facilities and experiments, providing researchers and their authorised
collaborators with easy self-service discovery and access to that data.</p>
<p>Generic services for Data storage via simple file shares, Integration
with cloud storage including<a href="http://dropbox.com/"><u> Dropbox.com</u></a>
and other distributed file systems. And Source-code repositories such as
public and private github and bitbucket stores for working code and
textual data.</p>
<p>Acting on data</p>
<p>The data Acquisition services described above are there in the first
instance to allow researchers to use data. With our environmental
researchers, we are developing techniques for developing reusable data
sets which include raw data, commented scripts to clean the data (eg a
comment “filter out known bad-days when the facility was not operating”)
then re-organize it via resampling or other operations into useful
‘clean’ data that can be fed to models, plotted etc and used as the
basis of publications. Demo: the presentation will include a live
demonstration of using HIEv to work on data and create a data archive.</p>
</section>
<section>
#### From action to archive
<p>Having created both re-usable base data sets and publication-specific
operations on data to create plots etc there are several workflows where
various parties trigger deposit of finished, fixed, citable data into a
repository. Our project team<a href="http://eresearch.uws.edu.au/blog/2012/08/17/potential-research-data-repository-data-management-use-cases-for-discussion/"><u> mapped out several scenarios where data
are deposited with different actors and
drivers</u></a>
including motivations that are both carrot (my data set will be cited)
and stick (the funder/journal says I have to deposit). Services are
being crafted to fit in with these identified workflows rather than
build new things and assume “they will come”.</p>
<p>Archiving the data</p>
<p>The University of Western Sydney has established a Research Data
Repositoryi (RDR), the central component of which is a Research Data
Catalogue, running on the<a href="http://www.redboxresearchdata.com.au/"><u> ReDBOX open source repository
platform</u></a>. While individual
data acquisition applications such as HIEv are considered to have a
finite lifespan, the RDR will provide on-going curation of important
research datasets. This service is set up to harvest data sets from the
working-data applications, including the HIEv data-acquisition
application and the CrateIt data packaging service using the Open
Archives Initiative – Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH).</p>
</section>
<section>
#### Advertising the data
<p>As with Institutional Publications Repositories, one of the key
functions of the Research Data Repository is to disseminate metadata
about holdings to aggregation services and give data a web presence.
Many Australian institutions are connected to the Research Data
Australia discovery service 6, which harvests metadata via an
ANDS-defined standard over the OAI-PMH harvesting protocol. There is so
far no Google-Scholar-like service which is harvesting data about data
sets via direct web crawling (that we know about), so there are no firm
standards for how to embed data in a page, but we are tracking the
developments of the Schema.org vocabulary, which is driven largely by
Google’s group of companies which are Google’s peers, and the work
described above on data packaging with RDFa metadata is intended to be
consumed by direct crawlers. It is possible to unzip a CrateIt package
and expose it to the web thus creating a machine-readable entry-point to
the data within the Zip/BagIt archive.</p>
<p>Looking to the future, the University is also considering plans for an
over-arching discovery hub, which would bring together all metadata data
about research including information on publications, people, and
organisation.</p>
</section>
<section>
#### Technical architecture
<p>The following diagram shows the first end-to-end data capture to
archiving pathways to be turned on at the University of Western Sydney,
covering Acquisition and Action on data (use) and Archiving and
Advertising of data for reuse. Note the inclusion of a name-authority
service which is used to ensure that all metadata flowing through the
system is unambiguous and inked-data-ready 7. The name Authority is
populated with data about people, grants and subject codes from
databases within the research services section of the university and
from community-maintained ontologies. A notable omission from the
architecture is integration with the Institutional Publications
Repository – we hope to be able to report on progress joining up that
piece of the infrastructure via a Research Hub at Open Repositories
2014.</p>
<p>i Project materials refer to the repository as a project which includes
both working and archival storage as well as some computing resources,
drawing a line around ‘the repository’ that is larger than would be
usual for a presentation at Open Repositories.</p>

## Notes
<p>This diagram shows the end to end data and application architecture
which Intersect and UWS eResearch built to capture data from HIE sensors
and other sources. Each of the columns roughly equates to the four A
model. Once data is packaged in the HIev, it is stored in the Research
Data Store and there is a corresponding record for it in the Research
Data Catalog. The data packaging format produced by the HIEv, along with
the delivery protocol are key to the architecture: the data packaging
format (based on bagit) is stand-alone from the HIEv and
self-describing, the delivery protocol (OAI-PMH) is well-defined and
standards based. THese are discussed in more detail in later slides.
When other data capature applications are developed at UWS, to integrate
into and extend the architecture they will simply need to package data
in the same format and produce and deliver the same meta-data via the
same delivery protocol as the HIEv.</p>

## Notes
<p>This diagram shows how the four 'A's fit together for HIE. Acquisition
and action are closely related - it is important to provide services
which researchers actually want to use and to build in data publishing
and packaging services rather than setting up an archive, and hoping
they come to it with data.</p>

<p>Completed packages flow-through to the Research Data Catalogue via an
OAI-PMH feed, and there they are given a DOI so they can be cited. The
hand-off between systems is important, once a DOI is issued the data set
has to be kept indefinitely and must not be changed.</p>

## Notes
<p>I said I'd talk about the long tail. He are two.</p>
<p>We looked in some detail at how the HIEv data capture application works
for environmental data - but what about researchers who are on the long
tail, and who don't have specific software applications for their group?</p>
<p>We are working on a similar Acquire and Act service that will operate
with files and trying to make it as useful and attractive as possible.
Most research teams we talk to at UWS are using Dropbox or one of the
other 'Share, Sync, See' services. Dropbox has limitation on what we can
do with its APIs and does not play nicely with authentication schemes
other than its own, so we are looking at building 'Acquire and Act'
services using an open source alternative; ownCloud.</p>
<p>Our application is known as <a href="http://eresearch.uws.edu.au/blog/projects/capturing-data-and-files-into-a-research-data-catalogue/"><u>Cr8it
</u></a>(Crate-it).</p>

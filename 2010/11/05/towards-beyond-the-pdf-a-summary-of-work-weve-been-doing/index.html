<p>There's a workshop happening in the USA in February [update: I mean
January] 2011 called<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/beyondthepdf/"><span> Beyond the
PDF</span></a>. This is really
exciting, as we have been working for years here at USQ, and with
collaborators such as Peter Murray-Rust and Jim Downing from Cambridge
on just that: getting beyond the PDF in academia. I'm pleased to see
this movement starting to get some traction. In this post I want to both
catalogue some of the work we've done that's relevant to this workshop
if only to remind myself, but also to look at some of the issues that
will be relevant to the workshop aims.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Immediate Goal:</strong> The goal of this workshop is not to produce a
white paper! Rather it is to identify a set of requirements, and a
group of willing participants to develop open source code to
accelerate knowledge sharing. Our starting point, and the only
prerequisite to participating, is the belief that we need to
move <em>Beyond the PDF</em>. Specifically, we think that better integration
between the research paper and research data is imperative - see our
papers for more details on this thinking, and please add your own so
we know your thoughts!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The workshop is not all about technology it's about ecosystems and
workflows, and changing practice. So while I will go through some of the
technologies we've been working on I'll start with some of my ideas
about the bigger picture. I will follow up this post with some
demonstrations targeted at the <em>Beyond the PDF</em> sample files so if
you're short of time, you might like to skip all this and wait for the
show and tell.</p>
<h1><a name="id2"></a>Issues</h1>
<p>Some of the big issues as I see them are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>We have to bring tools to the researcher's desktop</strong> that help
them to manage their data and make the links between publications
and the web of data. There are a few different, overlapping 'camps'
there are LaTeX users, there are legions of Word (and
OpenOffice.org) users, there may be some disciplines where
researchers are writing XML. That's the authoring tools. Then there
are the workflow tools, where we have SharePoint, Sakai, Drupal, et
al and plain-old file-shares, revision control system and all too
often the dreaded email and there's the scientific infrastructure
that generates a lot of the data, microscopes and cameras and
specialised instruments of every stripe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Publishers.</strong> We can't ignore them. We either have to work with
them or route around them, creating new publishing channel. I
explored this <a href="http://ptsefton.com/2009/08/19/towards-scholarly-html.htm"><span>in a paper in Serials
Review.</span></a>
One of the big issues is that if people are focussed on writing for
publication, and the publisher takes their manuscript and then does
stuff to it and hoards the result, then that breaks the end-to-end
semantically-rich publishing workflow we should be looking at.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To illustrate the potential divide between the author<span
class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>s version and the publisher<span
class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>s, consider that Elsevier, the
publisher of this journal, recently ran a competition, Article
2.0<span class="T6">9</span> to show the future of a scientific
article. The competition winner shows that a journal article may
be the Web locus for discussion, annotation and semantic
relationships, but this competition was built on XML source
documents which are created and held by the publisher, so there is
no way that a typical institutional repository could easily
provide the same services. This is a case where the publisher is
shaping scholarly communications, or at least exploring how to do
so, but a lack of tools means that repositories are unlikely to be
able to do likewise. This creates a distinct divide between the
publisher<span class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>s more richly
marked-up version and the version held by the author in word
processing format or the typesetting system LaTeX,<span
class="T6">10</span> neither of which allow high quality HTML
unless the author has used a particular set of templates and/or
macros and has access to specific conversion software. So there is
no way for most author manuscripts, which are commonly deposited
in institutional repositories, to be turned into usable Web
content, let alone with links to data and semantic-Web content.
The best most authors could hope for with their version would be
to convert it to PDF and deposit in a repository, while the
publisher can do much more with the article.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Theses.</strong> As Peter Murray-Rust has often pointed out, getting the
early career researchers is key <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> and theses are a form of
'publication' where institutions and disciplines control the entire
process so we can innovate, and produce 'beyond PDF' ready
researcher at the same time. Having a thesis strand in anything that
comes out of the workshop is probably a good idea.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Identifying things</strong>. As has already been discussed on the Beyond
PDF list, sorting out author names is imperative, to which I would
add we should also get really basic stuff like subject codes and
terms such as resource types. The most obvious approach these days
is to follow Linked Data principles and define URIs for key terms,
people, projects etc. We'll be building a mesh of services with
local, discipline, national infrastructure all interoperating.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Many of these themes we covered in the <a href="http://ptsefton.com/2010/04/25/repositories-post-2010-embracing-heterogeneity-in-awe-the-academic-working-environment.htm"><span>paper I presented at Open
Repositories
2010</span></a>,
co-authored with Duncan Dickinson. <strong>What lies beyond PDF?</strong> I'd say
that it's <strong>pretty obviously The Web</strong>, which is why I
<a href="http://ptsefton.com/2009/03/31/scholarly-html.htm"><span>coined</span></a>
the phrase <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span><a href="http://delicious.com/ptsefton/ptsefton+scholarlyhtml"><span>Scholarly
HTML</span></a><span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>. Below I'll revisit some of the issues
around what this means.</p>
<h1><a name="id3"></a>Technologies and ideas</h1>
<p>OK, so the goal of Beyond the PDF is to change science, which I'm taking
in the broad sense of the word. In Australia we use the term eResearch
rather than eScience so as to include the humanities. What follows is a
disorganised catalogue of work I've been involved in that is relevant to
getting beyond PDF.</p>
<h2><a name="id4"></a>Getting on the web</h2>
<p>One of the main things I have been working on for the last fifteen years
is helping people get stuff onto the web. Actually on the web as HTML,
not as Word documents or PDF or Flash Paper. You'd think that would be a
solved problem <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> but the fact that
we have to have a workshop called 'beyond PDF' is testament to the fact
this is is well and truly not solved. The system we developed at USQ to
help teachers get their distance-ed materials online and into print, via
their word processor is called ICE: <a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/"><span>The Integrated Content
Environment</span></a> (Sefton 2006). We have
explored how ICE can be used for research publication, most importantly
for theses (Sefton &amp; Downing 2010; Sefton et al. 2009; Sefton 2007). I
am firmly of the opinion that given the right authoring tools, HTML can
be 'the' format for research publications (we might put them in PDF to
print them). I went through some of the reasoning behind this in a
<a href="http://ptsefton.com/2010/08/11/ice-to-docbook-yes-but-i-wouldnt-bother.htm"><span>recent post about whether it is worthwhile to hook up word
processing templates to the DocBook
XML</span></a>
schema. That article quotes Mark Pilgrim on how he moved his Dive into
Python book from DocBook to HTML. <strong>One idea for the workshop</strong>: I am
pretty sure we could come up with a format based on HTML 5 using
Microformats, RDFa etc <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> this would
mean you could drop articles straight into a blog, and Google Scholar
could index them directly <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> and you
could still feed them through print publishing processes as XML. HTML 5
has section elements, and an article element, and support for extending
semantics. Take the <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2010/04/better-recipes-on-web-introducing.html"><span>recipe
microformat</span></a>.
Lots of scientific papers are pretty recipe-like. <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2010/04/better-recipes-on-web-introducing.html"><span>Google
says</span></a>:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>(Pay attention to Google. I think we should all remember what happened
with OAI-PMH which was 'our' format. Google tried that briefly then went
and built Google Scholar to web-crawl HTML, harvesting metadata that's
embedded in web pages. I would bet on the same process happening with
full-text content <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> they're not
going to be interested in XML, so important semantics will have the
surfaced in HTML, and if we're doing that then why bother with the
intermediate format?) We have some ongoing work on how to add semantics
to documents using the tools people really use (ie not XML editors). We
did some explorations of how to embed metadata using styles and other
techniques (Sefton et al. 2009), but I am really excited about new
approaches to this problem which would work by extending the model that
Microsoft introduced with their Ontology plugin for Microsoft Word
(about which there was a <a href="http://ptsefton.com/2009/03/27/more-on-microsoft-collaboration-and-word-processor-interop.htm"><span>fierce debate last
year</span></a>).
I'll post some demos of the kind of thing I'm talking about including
what author tools might look like and ideas for how to embed semantics
of all kinds in documents.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Embedding metadata</strong> in-line in-context. This would mean not only
that we know who is an author, but that the instance of their name
in the document is labelled with an identifier and a metadata
property that indicates the relationship between that person and
this document. This will allow for richer semantics than can be
captured using the field-value approach taken by the core document
metadata in office documents, and to tie metadata semantics to
inline context <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> making it
possible for both users and machines to explore semantic webs with
document text (or other content) as jumping-off points. So
references to contributors and journals would be linked formally and
explicitly with useful URIs.We did some work on mechanism for this
using styles, tables etc but at the moment I think the best approach
will be to use links <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> will
explain and demo this further.</li>
<li><strong>Embedding references</strong> to ontologies and taxonomies/controlled
vocabularies and geographical relationships with explicit
relationships(Explicit relationships are important <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> is this document 'about' this kind
of lizard or is the reference to a lizard part of statement of what
is <strong>not</strong> in scope?)</li>
<li>(Experimentally) <strong>Labelling structural components of documents</strong> to
assist in automated conversion to publisher DTDs or directly
producing Scholarly HTML. For example a section with a heading <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>Method<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> could be labelled with a link to the
definition for methodology from the NLM DTD, but the section could
also be entitled something like <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>procedure<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> or <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>what we did<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> but still have the <em>meaning</em> of
Methodology. This would also allow a section to potentially be
associated with more than one document schema. This class of
semantics might improve document conversion processes in a similar
way to the way heading styles are widely used now, with more
semantic rigour and depth.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="id6"></a>Improving repository models</h2>
<p>A current R&amp;D topic in my team at ADFI at the moment is how to improve
on the current IR information model. We're working on a couple of
fronts.</p>
<ol>
<li>Exploring, on the <a href="http://www.ands-partners.org/blog/category/redbox/"><span>ReDBox
project</span></a>
which is funded by the Australian National Data Service, how we can
describe research data collections, and then post those descriptions
to the national aggregation service, via the institutional
repository. Part of this work involved establishing an authority
control service <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>The Mint<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> to handle names as well as subject
codes and ontologies, such as geonames. We think you need a source
of data that can be made to interact with other tools in a
developer-friendly way, We have been working on ways that web
developers can look up stuff in The Mint <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> such as building UIs to help people
in resolving the string <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>John
Smith<span class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> to a URI for the right
Smith, and Toowoomba to the right Toowoomba, not the wrong
one.Here's a screenshot of the interface in action on the
forthcoming USQ Arts repository<span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span>
this is helping me pick the <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>Peter Sefton<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> I mean here.
<a name="graphics1"></a><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/m5b98c768_440x290.jpeg" alt="graphics1" />
We need all these bits and pieces of infrastructure to start
stitching together the services we'll need to go beyond PDF <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> pure RDF is not enough this stuff
needs to be built into tools.</li>
<li>Getting a richer information model to describe the parts of a
publication and its related data. The first round of Institutional
repositories were not that great at this. You could attach various
versions of a paper to a record, but it was not usually clear which
was the pre-print, the presentation, the published version, or what
might be a data set apart from clues in the file name.Duncan
Dickinson in my team has worked to expand on outcomes from the
Kultur project in the UK, to set up a repository which can use a
rich information model to show the relationships between research
objects in the arts using the <a href="http://www.vrafoundation.org/ccoweb/index.htm"><span>Cataloguing Cultural
Objects</span></a> (CCO)
standard. This will help the repository to keep track of
relationship subtleties such as the difference between a photograph
of a work which is a painting and a photograph which is the work
itself, or a photograph which is of three works, etc. The same kind
of infrastructure will be needed for the management systems we use
for bringing together publications and data <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> with different information models
and vocabularies for different domains.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="id8"></a>Packaging</h2>
<p>When you look at multiple formats of a document, supporting data, and
relations between them packaging becomes important. I'm sure OAI-ORE
will be a favourite with the Beyond PDF crowd, but that's a technical
framework, not an end-user tool. We've been looking at things that
<em>people</em> can use to do the packaging, so that machines can handle things
like ORE. We're <a href="http://ptsefton.com/2010/08/13/epub-as-a-way-of-packaging-scholarly-resources.htm"><span>exploring EPub as a packaging
format</span></a>
for exchange and dissemination with easy to use tools. Another idea
we're working on is to make self contained HTML <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>apps<span class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>
for scholarly objects <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> ie package a
document, data (or links to it) and visualisations etc into one live
thing. Including interaction as well. We have a basic JavaScript toolkit
for this called Paquete <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> the idea
is that an document, or aggregation of stuff can be moved around by
doing a 'Save as' and an HTML 5 compliant browser will use the manifest
to grab all the bits and pieces. The <a href="http://demo.adfi.usq.edu.au/paquete/demo/#module01.htm"><span>Paquete demo shows how a
bunch of document parts can be packaged and
served</span></a>
<span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> imagine this model extended to
include research data and richer relations between document and data. It
is held together with a
<a href="http://demo.adfi.usq.edu.au/paquete/demo/#module02.htm"><span>manifest</span></a>
which could be enriched with more detailed relationship information and
transformed to OAI-ORE if necessary. Paquete can allow adding and moving
resources as well via drag and drop when embedded in an application.</p>
<h2><a name="id9"></a>Annotation</h2>
<p>Finally, we're looking at the all-important annotation. We are
<a href="https://fascinator.usq.edu.au/trac/wiki/Annotate/existing"><span>aware of the work going on in this
area</span></a>,
particularly in the Open Annotation Consortium and we plan to
interoperate with their protocols, but our approach is a little
different than most web-scale annotation systems and proposals. We see
the need to add annotation services to lots of different systems, on
lots of different kinds of material, text, image, video, visualisation
such as a molecules etc. Our work has been on making an easy to deploy
web toolkit that can add such services to existing or new applications.
We are focussing on adding annotation to a web service, not building
generic clients with the Anotar toolkit. There are two major design
patterns.</p>
<ol>
<li>Build the annotations in to an existing system as an extension. For
example <a href="http://adfi.usq.edu.au/dev_blog/2010/04/23/anotar-wordpress-an-example-of-how-to-design-an-anotar-plugin/"><span>the work I did with Ron Ward on adding annotations to
WordPress</span></a>.</li>
<li>Allow aggregation across multiple systems. We don't have live
exemplars yet but the idea would be to add annotations to multiple
systems which would store them back to a central store. Greg
Pendlebury has talked about this with
<a href="http://vufind.org/"><span>VuFind</span></a> developers <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> multiple sites, which might not even
be running the same software could be set up so collect annotations
(comments, tags, taxonomic tags etc) on items to increase the number
of participants in the crowd.</li>

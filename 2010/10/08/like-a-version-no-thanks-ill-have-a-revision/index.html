<p><a href="http://blog.tomw.net.au/"><span>Tom Worthington</span></a> has been
dropping names again. Mine this time, and Martin Dougiamas'.</p>
<p>Tom's thinking about version control for academia, <a href="http://blog.tomw.net.au/2010/10/version-control-killer-app-for-higher.html"><span>wondering if
it's a killer
app</span></a>.
He tells a story about meeting a professor who is swamped with documents
managed in email, of all places:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span
style="color:#000000; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:normal; letter-spacing:normal; text-transform:none; "><span
class="T5">During the World Computer Congress in Brisbane I talked to
a university professor who was </span></span><a href="http://blog.tomw.net.au/2010/09/digital-education-revolution-skills.html"><span>having problems
with
email</span></a><span
style="color:#000000; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:normal; letter-spacing:normal; text-transform:none; "><span
class="T5">. They were keeping copies of all messages from students
and book collaborators in the university mail system. As a result
their mail box was clogged with copies of draft papers and books. This
was partly a failure of the university's administration in not
providing suitable online tools for handling large documents which
will be required for several years. However, it was also a conceptual
failure. When I asked them about version control, they looked at me
blankly. I had assumed that this would be something familiar to any
professional handling large amounts of information, but it appears to
be confined to engineers and IT professionals.</span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't think this is just about version/revision control. It's
multidimensional. And while version control looks like a no-brainer to a
luminary of the Australian Computer Society, just like XML publishing or
TeX, look like great ideas to various computer scientists who have seen
the benefits, none of those things have really stuck with general users.
My approach is to look at the consumer-level tools that are successful
at building a user-base without training courses or coercion, and think
about how we can apply the same ideas. I'm not saying that Tom's wrong,
just that we need to look at solutions that help people transcend the
limitations of their current systems without them having to learn
complicated new stuff, 'cos most of them just won't.</p>
<p>We all need:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Collaborative storage spaces</strong> for workgroups who need to work on
the same files and might all need to edit the same thing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Collaborative systems</strong> for seeking input or comment from people
who aren't in our immediate cohort:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Document review by teams, committees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comments on draft documents such as theses, by supervisors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Marking systems for assignment assessment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Review systems for peer-review or formal document approval
processes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Publishing systems and channels</strong> which increasingly need to cater
for web and mobile-web consumption, and ideally should have a
feedback/discussion channel so people can engage with your stuff.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To course participants, often in a Learning Management System
such as Moodle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To the world, via blogs etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Via publishers and conferences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To our university administration for compliance reasons, we need
to be able to deposit data for retention, and published works in
the repository, etc.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Version control is pertinent in all of these contexts but it has
different flavours and requirements. Tom's right, email is not the way
to do any of these effectively, except in its role as a notifying
service, but at least it does capture snapshots of file versions
as-mailed, which is more than most file-systems do.</p>
<p>There are lots of systems that academics currently have to use to do the
above content management tasks, which may or may not keep track of
'versions' in their own way, more or less effectively. Here at USQ
SharePoint is used by a lot of workgroups for collaboration, for
example. It has some kind of version control built in. Then there are
systems like OJS for managing journals where there is a form of version
control, in that one version of paper is sent to reviewers and things
move through the journal publishing lifecycle. And if you post something
to a blog, that creates a kind of point-in-time snapshot of a document
(as long as you don't go changing it later).</p>
<p>We're working on range of systems at ADFI, using a mixture of building
things that don't exist and interfacing with things that do.</p>
<p>My current thoughts follow. Just thoughts.</p>
<h1><span id="id2"></span><span></span></a>Collaborative services</h1>
<p>For local collaboration <a href="http://dropbox.com/"><span>DropBox</span></a> is a
killer app. You can see and use the same files across multiple devices
(for me that's 3 Linux computers, an iPad and an Android phone) via
miraculous file replication. It does version control in the sense that
you can go back to an old version of something (revision control,
really). It stays out of the way until two people edit the same thing at
the same time, then it gracefully creates a new version of one of the
files, labelled as 'conflicted', and the authors can sort out the mixup.
We need a version of this that can be run at the institutional or
workgroup level. Seriously. (And don't talk to me about the ARCS data
fabric, WebDAV does not work. It doesn't. Not like DropBox).</p>
<p>When we built <a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/"><span>ICE</span></a>, using the
Subversion system as a replication back end, it was something like
DropBox we were really striving for. Now that it's arrived, running ICE
over the top of DropBox is a really good way for teams to collaborate
<span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> everyone can access shared files,
they automatically turn into web pages, and groups can comment on a
documents via the web-view. We do this to maintain the CAIRSS document
intranet, and publish the
<a href="http://cairss.caul.edu.au/www/index.htm"><span>website</span></a>. Give or
take a few ICE bugs that works really well. This is a design pattern
we'll definitely pursue with our work on The Fascinator repository
toolkit <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> having a system sit on top
of a shared file store and provide a web view of content that you can
use to organize, annotate and publish that content.</p>
<p>We're looking at other design patterns, to help with
annotation/discussion and web conversion services for people who might
be committed-to or stuck-with sytems like SharePoint, Sakai, Drupal et
al.</p>
<h1><span id="id3"></span><span></span></a>Publishing</h1>
<p>One of the projects ADFI is working on is a repository to sit behind the
Moodle LMS, to manage learning and teaching content of all kinds. This
could well end up providing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A quality controlled repository of courseware, including Open Access
courseware that is flagged as such.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A place for teachers to collaborate on course materials prior to
publishing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An engine for learners and teachers to discuss and engage with
content and each other, via an interface that appears in Moodle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A system to automatically convert stuff into the formats required
for delivery on various platforms including mobile, and paper.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A way to bring all this above together, to allow (say) collaborative
annotation on phones and PCs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the academic publishing world things are a bit harder to influence,
but I am still trying to find a way to make progress on the idea of
<a href="http://delicious.com/ptsefton/ptsefton+scholarlyhtml"><span>Scholarly
HTML</span></a> -
there's an upcoming workshop in the USA I'd like to attend, and some
promising discussion with JISC in the UK about the potential for ePub
publishing.</p>
<h1><span id="id4"></span><span></span></a>Some final thoughts on version control</h1>
<p>Finally, Tom's post has prompted em to try to write down some of what
I've been working on re version control. What's a model that will work
for your general academic?</p>
<p>For close collaboration with colleagues I think we need to supply
something like DropBox, a magic file system that makes sharing
automatic. Version control in this environment would be be simply the
ability to go back to previous versions if needed. (This is really what
I think most theorists would call 'revision' control'), I have used this
a few times in DropBox to get myself out of trouble <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> but I'm not sure its anywhere near as
important as the magical ability to have your files available anywhere,
including via the web.</p>
<p>When do you need an actual version of a file, rather than a revision?</p>
<p>I think it's basically when you share something <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> and you need to be able to agree/prove
that a particular version of a file is what you're both working with.
Sharing is a kind of publishing.</p>
<p>While DropBox is good for pre-publication sharing, I think it would be
good to add to the features in DropBox to handle the act of making a
published version of something. Sure, I can use it to share a folder,
but what I want to be able to do is a kind of publishing <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> to create a stable version of a resource
that's URL addressable, and that others can comment on and discuss, but
not necessarily edit. The idea would be to take a file, a document,
image, dataset, whatever and make a blogable version of it <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> DropBox can't do this, but the ADFI
software stack we've been building for years <strong>can</strong>.</p>
<p>I've been wondering if the blog publishing model might not be a good way
to do this in a number of contexts. After all, the simples version of a
weblog is just a series of time-ordered resources. You could post the
same item multiple times, and get snapshot versions of it that persist
over time. Remember, blog is short for web<strong>log</strong>. You get a <strong>log</strong> of
document publishing events.</p>
<p>Want to share something for comment? 'Blog' it.</p>
<p>The act of publishing gives your document/file a URL that locks it in
time. You could have a 'blog' channel set up for a
student-plus-supervisor, for example, and others for team-collaboration
and sub teams. Add-in sophisticated commenting features and you have a
collaboration environment. We have been (slowly) working on this with
our Anotar project, <a href="http://adfi.usq.edu.au/dev_blog/2010/04/23/anotar-wordpress-an-example-of-how-to-design-an-anotar-plugin/"><span>adding paragraph level annotations to
WordPress</span></a>
<span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> which would make this a fairly
simple thing to set up for anyone with a server (or you could use
<a href="http://digress.it/"><span>http://digress.it</span></a>).</p>
<p>I've got a complicated diagram on my whiteboard, which tries to show an
architecture for how a set of blogs might sit in between files storage
(a la DropBox) and things like public sites, or learning management
systems. The idea would be that you would push 'files' to different
public 'blog' spaces for discussion/approval, and from there to things
like public websites, or the LMS etc. It's probably a stupid
architecture, but I do think that we need to look carefully at how we
can let people have 'version control' without them having to learn about
it. I mean, I work in a team of people who can all use Subversion to
manage their code, but nobody is really inclined to use it for our main
file-sharing / management.</p>

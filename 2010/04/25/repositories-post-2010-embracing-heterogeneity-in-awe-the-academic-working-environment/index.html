international conference on Open Repositories list nine polar
dichotomies that represent <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>The
Grand Integration Challenge<span class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> for the
repository community/movement. In this paper we take up the challenge.
We do so in the context of a program of work being undertaken at our
institution to build infrastructure for the academy in general, working
towards a modular 'Academic Working Environment' (AWE) which encompasses
both teaching and learning on one hand and research on the other.
Repositories and the ecosystem of services and workflows that surround
them play a key role in this emerging system.</p>
<h1>1 Introduction</h1>
<p>This presentation uses the conference organizers' description of current
issues in repositories as a way to structure discussion about a program
being undertaken at the Australian Digital Futures Institute; The
Academic Work Environment (AWE). The presentation will look at each of
the integration challenges listed on the call for papers: the web and
the repository, knowledge and technology,wild and curated content,
linked and isolated data, disciplinary and institutional systems,
scholars and service providers, ad-hoc and long-term access, ubiquitous
and personalized environments, the cloud and the desktop.</p>
<h1>2 AWE: Meeting the grand challenges for repositories</h1>
<p>The Academic Work Environment (AWE) is a label for a set of services and
computational systems that support the academic enterprise. The acronym
was coined to capture under a single identifier a range of research and
development work going on in a group tasked with pragmatic, practical
work on workflows and computer systems for eLearning and eResearch.</p>
<h2>2.1 The web and the repository &amp; The cloud and the desktop</h2>
<p>It is telling that <span class="Apple-style-span" mce_name="em"
mce_style="font-style: italic;" style="font-style: italic;"><span>the
web vs the repository</span></span> is posed as a dichotomy or a
challenge. While repositories are, by default, web-based systems the
vast majority of document content housed in repositories is in a non-web
format, PDF. Furthermore, vast amounts of potential repository content
such as data-files are excluded from the repository, and from the
web/cloud because of the lack of services that assist academic users in
making their content available on the web. The Academic Work Environment
addresses both of the issues identified above with systems to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Allow academic documents to be made available in HTML as well as
PDF. This work, based on The Integrated Content Environment
(<a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/">ICE</a>) was presented at Open Repostiories
2009 (Sefton, Downing, &amp; Day, 2009). Uptake on this has been very
slow, but repositories need to start using web formats if they are
to be part of the web and fulfill the promise of integrated
documents and data as envisaged by Murray Rust and Rzepa
(Murray-Rust &amp; Rzepa, 2004).</li>
<li>Begin to close the gap between the desktop work environment and the
repository via an application which bring a web-based repository
view to all the files that a researcher/educator is using; allowing
them to describe them, back them up and have them routed to
appropriate repository for works-in-progress and completed research
outputs as appropriate. (Dickinson &amp; Sefton, 2009; Sefton, 2009)</li>
</ol>
<p>Other work in this area includes Microsoft Research's work on embedding
SWORD <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> named OfficeSWORD<span
class="footnote" mce_style="vertical-align: super;"
style="vertical-align: super;">
<span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> repository deposit into their word
processing product as well as some attempts to allow structured
authoring and semantic web-authoring in the browser (Fernicola, 2009;
Fink et al., 2010).</p>
<h2>2.2 Knowledge and technology</h2>
<p>Whilst individual web-pages may contain information that people can use
to construct knowledge, the technology of the web itself is largely
ignorant to the concept of information and the notion of a body of
information being spread across the network. Authors may hyperlink to
provide readers with further context but the web browser is a
dumb-terminal that understands nothing about the actual information
embedded in the content. Search engines provide a basic entry point to
the information network but their reliance is on key phrases and not the
context and meaning understood by a community of practice (Neumann &amp;
Prusak, 2007). The challenge now is to open up the information existing
in online forms <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> including
documents and data <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> so that it is
findable<span class="footnote" mce_style="vertical-align: super;"
style="vertical-align: super;">,
a concept that spans more than just matching keywords:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any system aiming to integrate heterogeneous data on an ad hoc basis
and present this to users will need to adopt sophisticated models of
relevance, quality, and trust that are sensitive to the user<span
class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>s current task and its context. (Heath
Heath, 2008 p. 91)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Heath's discussion here is focused on the Semantic Web. Based on
technologies from groups such as the W3C<span class="footnote"
mce_style="vertical-align: super;"
style="vertical-align: super;">,
the Semantic Web provides a framework within the Web that gives web
browsers and search engines the ability to interact with information.
Navigation in this model is based on assembling meaning rather than
merely providing presentation services (Heath, 2008). The challenge,
then, is to get the semantics into the Semantic Web. Within the AWE we
are looking at methods that allow researchers to easily provide semantic
information in their data and documents. The Anotar<span
class="footnote" mce_style="vertical-align: super;"
style="vertical-align: super;">
project presented a framework for adding semantics through the well
understood concept of tagging and extending this by allowing taxonomies
to be utilised. Created as an easy to adopt toolkit, Anotar is being
adapted to systems such as The Fascinator, Moodle and WordPress. Initial
pilot work has also been undertaken to provide facilities for adding
semantic information to word processed documents so that semantic <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>mark up<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> can be created with the document rather
as a deferred technical effort (Sefton, 2009).</p>
<h2>2.3 Wild and curated content</h2>
<p>The AWE approach to wild and curated content is to gradually tame and
domesticate the content, by allowing it to be husbanded by a series of
'curation events'. Using the Fascinator Desktop, The initial creator may
label data items or sets in simple ad-hoc terms using tags such as <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>My Thesis<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> or <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>Anthropology 101 Course Notes<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>. The incentive to do this is that when
they do so, the items will be (a) backed up appropriately and (b) routed
to collaborators automatically. This represents what we might call an
emergent workflow; where object state changes result in items making
progress through required stages.</p>
<p>We also provide a more intentional kind of curation via 'acts of
publishing' where a data owner can push content across curation
boundaries (the term coined by ARROW project members (Treloar,
Groenewegen, &amp; Harboe-Ree, 2007)) for various reasons;</p>
<ul>
<li>a draft can be pushed to a blog (remember that, using ICE content
services, all word processing documents in the Academic Working
Environment are web-ready and can be delivered as HTML)</li>
<li>a finished paper or approved draft can be pushed to the
institutional repository. Work is under way to enable this to happen
in a way that (a) data is also deposited and (b) both document and
data are web-ready and can be viewed in-browser as native web
content, as well as being available for print .</li>
</ul>
<h2>2.4 Linked and isolated data &amp; Ad-hoc and long-term access</h2>
<p>Bootstrapping the linked-data web remains a grand challenge, but we are
attempting to address it in work on The Fascinator Desktop by providing
URIs (the formal name for links) for data while it is still in isolation
in a lab or on a laptop computer for example. Managing identifiers
through the lifecycle of a digital object is not easy when you consider
that a researcher may have their digital files spread across multiple
desktop, portable and mobile devices and that, in the messy landscape of
desktop filesystems, filenames are changed at a whim and multiple
versions may exist throughout a system.</p>
<p>Within The Fascinator, every item will have a URI from the moment it is
discovered on the user's desktop.</p>
<p>Creating a URI for desktop files is a similar approach to the SemDeskURI
Scheme suggested by members of the Nepomuk<span class="footnote"
mce_style="vertical-align: super;"
style="vertical-align: super;">
project (Sauermann, 2008). However, instead of relying on a new protocol
(in the case of SemDeskUri this is <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span><span class="Apple-style-span"
mce_name="em" mce_style="font-style: italic;"
style="font-style: italic;">desktop://<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span></span>), URIs in The Fascinator will
utilise <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span><span
class="Apple-style-span" mce_name="em" mce_style="font-style: italic;"
style="font-style: italic;">http://</span><span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>. For example, whilst <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>http://localhost/dickinso@usq.edu.au/research/data<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> will not allow remote users to access
the resource, it does provide for contextual identification.</p>
<p>In terms of ad-hoc vs long-term access, under this scheme we would
expect resources to move from an isolated desktop-web view of digital
objects (remembering that our systems give people a web view from the
very creation of the object) to ad-hoc team views where the provenance
of items is preserved by keeping both desktop and team-URIs, through to
more formally created views. As content is routed from the desktop to
shared repositories the plan is to keep the URIs, so that the metadata
for an item contains all of the known identifiers that we have for it.</p>
<h2>2.5 Disciplinary and institutional systems / Scholars and service providers</h2>
<p>Whilst much of this presentation has focused on the technical aspects of
<span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>The Grand Integration
Challenge<span class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>, the complexity of
institutional and individual engagement must be considered. This is a
challenge that threads through numerous areas of academia, including
postgraduate researcher skills, central ICT provision, Government
reporting requirements, Library systems, research project management
etc. Indeed, it presents a <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>wicked
problem<span class="spCh spChx201d">”</span><span class="footnote"
mce_style="vertical-align: super;"
style="vertical-align: super;">
for the academic research sector and is one that various stakeholders
approach with a carrot and/or stick approach.</p>
<p>From the carrot side, we are working with motivated pilot users and
faculties to build the AWE to meet their needs. Another carrot, of
course, is grants - such as those offered by the Australian National
Data Service <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> to teams developing
solutions. The stick often presents itself as institutionalised mandates
(<span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>Data-sharing culture has
changed,<span class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> 2009; Australian
Government, 2007) but for many researchers, the technical complexities
around data management are an intrusion into their time (Henty, Weaver,
Bradbury, &amp; Porter, 2008). As mentioned earlier, a central goal of the
AWE is to provide services that meet the various stakeholder demands but
don't interfere with the researcher's core tasks.</p>
<h2>2.6 Ubiquitous and personalized environments</h2>
<p>Two central goals of the AWE are to hide the technicalities around data
management and the semantic web and to provide services that meet
various stakeholder demands. These goals are both aimed at allowing the
researcher to focus on their research. We envisage a mesh of repository
services, building on the existing standards for linking repository
content; the Fascinator Desktop work (and before it The Integrated
Content Environment) introduces the idea of a personal desktop web; with
services such as tagging and note-taking acting not only in their
traditional role of assisting in the research process, but as triggers
in emergent workflows.</p>
<p>A good example to illustrate how the personal and ubiquitous can meet
and <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>intermesh<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> is our work on a general framework for
annotations, Anotar. In work extending from that described in Dickinson
and Sefton (2009), we are adding Anotar annotation services to The
Fascinator. In the case of our work with USQ's Public Memory Research
Centre, this facility will allow the researcher to tag photos in their
desktop repository for release to an online repository for viewing.
Research participants can log onto this repository and provide the
researcher with essential information regarding the people and locations
in various photos and movies through the use of taxonomy-based tagging.
Furthermore, the open-ended nature of the annotations will provide an
online forum for the participants to share their memories and even
debate points of view <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> providing a
rich data-set for the researcher as well as a first-person public memory
archive.</p>
<p>Whilst tagging and annotation services are provided (to some extent) by
various online Web 2.0 systems, the AWE solution meets research-specific
data management requirements by keeping research data in a way that
adheres to the University's ethical clearance requirements. For the
researcher and their community of participants, it provides a
personalized environment that lets them focus on their own goals rather
than the technical infrastructure.</p>
<h1>3 Conclusion</h1>
<p>The Academic Working Environment is not a single monolithic application
with a <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>one size fits all<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> approach. Its name defines its
structure: an environment of interoperable services that works with the
researcher and doesn't hamper their efforts.</p>

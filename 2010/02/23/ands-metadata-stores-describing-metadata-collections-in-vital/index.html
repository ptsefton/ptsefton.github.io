ANDS metadata stores: Describing metadata collections in VITAL

<p>I'm at the University of Newcastle visiting repository rat
extraordinaire Vicki Picasso (actually at this bushland campus she
should be a repository wallaby or something) and her colleague Dave
Huthnance from IT. We are working on a model for how research data
collections destined for Research Data Australia might be described and
managed in the local institutional repository.</p>
<p>(Please ANDS can we have some advice on this metadata issue? Some of you
say to use RIF-CS and some say that's a bad idea.)</p>
<p>Vicki presented a model of how metadata about research data could be
ingested into the VITAL repository they use at Newcastle at eResearch
Australasia 2009; it featured the VALET system which is a very simple
repository ingest tool and what Vicki calls <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>Institutional Data Triggers<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> such as events in a grants database
which would fire-off a metadata ingest workflow.</p>
<h1><span id="id2"></span></a>The new model</h1>
<p>Today we refined that diagram. Like it says the <strong>blue bits</strong> represent
the current Nova repository infrastructure (VITAL + VALET + Fedora)
which feeds data to (amongst other things) the National Library's
harvesting systems.</p>
<p><strong>The red bits</strong> are new proposed infrastructure, to be developed, to
enable collections metadata to be captured and feeds of RIF-CS metadata
to Research Data Australia. The new red box labelled <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>Research Data Collections<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>, should it be built, will be a more
sophisticated version of VALET, probably written in Java so it can work
in the same Tomcat web container as Fedora <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> it would have a VALET-style simple forms
interface for walk-up submissions (this <em><span>could</span></em> be used to
replace the existing publications ingest and staging workflows too, as
shown by the dotted red line <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> if
this were a requirement).</p>
<p><strong>Green is for external services.</strong> One of the very interesting green
bits is the Research Storage system which is being provided by
university IT and administered by the Research Office. I gather that
this is essentially a file-store; we are proposing to add an interface
that lets researchers see their files in the new (red) ingest system and
add metadata to them, and flag them as candidates for RDA. I think
Newcastle's policy will be that if you want data to be available via
Research Data Australia then it is desirable this it goes in the
Research Storage System. Sounds good to me. To bridge the gap between
files on a storage system we are proposing a bit of middleware to link
the file view of data to a web/repository view.</p>
<p>As discussed before here, the ANDS stakeholders in this project are keen
for us to take a linked-data approach to metadata (slogan: Less typing,
more linking!). I talked a bit about how this might work <a href="http://ptsefton.com/2010/02/23/ands-metadata-stores-integrating-vital-with-the-nlas-party-infrastructure-project.htm">in the
previous post on name
identities</a>;
potential integration with services like the NLA's PIP/People Australia
and possible services like an ARC website for grant information are
shown in green at the bottom right of the diagram (I have some input
from Basil at the NLA I need to process, but at this stage I think we're
looking at having <a href="http://nicnamesproject.blogspot.com/">NicNames</a> in
there so institutions can manage their own metadata.</p>
<p><span
style="display: block"><a name="graphics1"></a><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/m117b3490_643x426.jpeg" alt="graphics1"></span></p>
<p>One assumption we're making here is that the core class of item we're
describing here is a collection, which should fit with the kind of data
that is already in the repository, which is <strong>research outputs</strong>, like
data.</p>
<p>There are some questions, of course.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What metadata schema to use for describing data collections?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And where would the ISO2146 notion of Services fit in? The services
listed in the RIF-CS documentation are all repository-type
search/feed services so it seems appropriate to either tie them in
to the OAI-PMH 'identify' verb or to let repository managers simply
enter them in to an ANDS system directly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1><span id="id4"></span></a>Going further</h1>
<p>One idea that has come up is that VITAL sites might want to use Fedora
and the OAI-PMH feeds available off it but not expose them via a web
portal at all. In conversation with Teula Morgan from Swinburne today,
Vicki proposed a model where there is no portal interface. I call this a
'headless' approach; there would be local management interface for
research data collection metadata (the red box) but it could be that the
primary discovery mechanism is outsourced to RDA. This is pretty common
for university web sites <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> USQ uses
Google for our website search service for example.</p>
<p>I am also exploring the idea that this ingest tool, which will be able
to put records into Fedora (which as far as I know nobody has ever been
fired for acquiring) could form the basis for our major deliverable on
our ANDS metadata stores project; a specification for a stand-alone
metadata -about-research-data-collection system.</p>

ANDS Metadata Stores: Integrating VITAL with the NLA&#39;s Party Infrastructure Project

<p>Here is some more news on the metadata stores project for ANDS (see
<a href="http://delicious.com/ptsefton/andsmetadatastores">previous posts</a>) and
how we might build links between VITAL/Fedora and an identity service
for people (parties in ANDS-speak). This is potentially a step on the
way to a linked-data future not just for research data but also for
institutional repositories.</p>
<p>Natasha Simons said, on the CAIRSS list:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An exciting new project, which was mentioned at the CAIRSS Community
Day last December, has commenced at the National Library of Australia
(NLA). The Australian Research Data Commons Party Infrastructure
Project (ARDCPIP) is an Australian National Data Service (ANDS) funded
project being carried out  by the NLA to enable improved discovery of
research outputs and data through assigning public and persistent
identifiers to Australian researchers and research organisations using
the NLA<span class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>s People Australia
Infrastructure. The project will involve consultation with the
research sector and more information about it will be made available
to you shortly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is good news for the metadata stores work we're doing with ANDS. I
was in Canberra in early February and we caught up with Basil Dewhurst
and Natasha; seems like the timing is good to try to get a link-up
between the work we're doing to sketch the design of a metadata store
for data on top of the VITAL repository.</p>
<h1><span id="id2"></span></a>Why is this important?</h1>
<p>One of the problems we have been talking about with ANDS is how to
represent people. In VITAL names are typically not subject to authority
control, and even if they are it is via some kind of people-driven
workflow, not a feature of the software. (Any exceptions to this? Please
let me know in the comments.)</p>
<p>The linked-data semantic web ideal would be for there to be some kind of
resolvable identifier stored each time a party is mentioned. You want at
least two bits of data (using the example that Basil gave in the
comments here last time).</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The name as it appears on a particular work that's a string, like
Cappo, Michael Charles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A URI <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> such as
<a href="http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-471077">http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-471077</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And maybe a canonical, normalized way of referring to the name for a
particular service <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> the heading
at the NLA's trove site is Cappo, Michael.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Possibly more URIs that refer to the same party.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we had this it would meant that submitting data about data
collections to the Australian Research Data Commons would be much
more concise and accurate <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> it
should not be necessary to include any party data at all in a feed
from a metadata store to the commons, just URIs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But, in the case of University X, not all the researchers have
persistent identifiers. So, I have suggested that we try to create
persistent identifiers for all parties as the first step in building
a metadata store on top of VITAL. This is good several ways:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having an early adopter on board will help the PIP project at the
NLA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This will bring together three ANDS funded projects and promote
general metadata harmony.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>University X will get a significant upgrade to the integrity and
usefulness of their existing data.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1><span id="id4"></span></a>How?</h1>
<p>What we're looking at is a pre-load stage to populate PIP/People
Australia with the identities of people already mentioned in the
repository.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Harvest name data from VITAL</strong> - could be via MARC / DC / or some
other format derived from those, over OAI-PMH or via some other
batch load. Contextual information is likely to be limited to
subject and affiliation data pretty much - you won't get birthdates.
Vicki Picasso tells me that at Newcastle they record which authors
belong to their institution, so for that institution this process
could concentrate on the authors they know are theirs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Records are auto-matched in <span>PIP</span></strong> using whatever
algorithms it has.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person (probably at University X) uses the NLA's private People
Australia tools to s<strong>ort out the name references and associate the
various publications with the right person ID.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the name data has been checked (step 3) the developer writes
some code to <strong>inject the ID data back into Fedora</strong>, in MARC (if
that's possible) or into a new datastream. (If my team got the job
we would do this by writing some custom index rules for our Fedora
indexer which is part of modular system that is <a href="http://fascinator.usq.edu.au/">The
Fascinator</a>.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The developer creates an ingest system (like VALET). As part of the
form-filling process it would look up name IDs at point of ingest
and trigger creation of new parties when one is not found. We will
write up more detail about how this would look, using Newcastle as
an example.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span
style="color:#000000; font-size:9.75pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:normal; letter-spacing:normal; text-transform:none; "><span
class="T1"><br>
</span></span>There is a variant on this where NicNames might be used in
between 1 &amp; 2 and PIP would be fed cleaner data.</p>
<p>Once the intial load was done, many names associated with data
collections would already have URIs so these would not have to be re
entered; for 'new' identities there would have to be some kind of system
for minting a new ID then flagging it for attention from a name-curator
at a later time.</p>
<h1><span id="id5"></span></a>Linked data more generally</h1>
<p>I have described a process here for party identities; it would also be
good to have the same kind of approach for activities (in the ISO-2146
sense) which means <strong>research projects</strong> in this context. Andrew Treloar
of ANDS Monash branch tells me that there has been talk of having the
major funding bodies like ARC provide a PIP-like service for grant
funded projects, providing some kind of URI that a human or a machine
could look up, getting a web page or an RDF record as appropriate. The
RDF record could be used to extract trusted data like project names at
both the repository and the ARDC registry but nobody would have to
re-type that data into a form.</p>
<p>Does anyone out there know anything about this potential service for
Activities? Can you comment?</p>

<p>This is the second post about the ANDS-funded metadata store work we're
doing at ADFI. The project now has a <a href="https://204.236.227.98/projects/metadatastore/trac/wiki/">Trac
site</a> where we
will be tracking progress and keeping notes; the site will be open to
the public to read, to make it as easy as possible to reach a wide range
of stakeholders, although there will be a few documents we have to keep
under tighter control. The Trac site will be mainly used as a project
wiki <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> but I will put in some job
tickets and use the milestones feature to track what happens between our
(mostly) weekly project meetings. <a href="https://204.236.227.98/projects/metadatastore/trac/milestone/2010-02-08">This week's milestone is up
now.</a></p>
<p>In this post I'll reveal some detail about our starting point (though
not the name of the institution(s) we'll be working with) and follow up
on some of the feedback I got from ANDS staffers to my <a href="http://ptsefton.com/2010/01/15/new-project-metadata-for-data-collections.htm">previous
post</a>.
Scott Yeadon raised quite a few points, some of which I will get to in
future posts and/or project plans and wiki pages.</p>
<h1><span id="id2"></span></a>Starting point</h1>
<p>ADFI staff met with ANDS stakeholders late in 2009, and we have agreed
that a good starting point will be to focus on one of the 'additional'
deliverables first. The core deliverable is a project plan to build a
stand- alone metadata store, with an option to write extra plans for
add-ons or customisations to existing repository software such as DSpace
or Eprints should any organisations want to keep metadata about data
collections in their IR. It happens that there has been a fair bit of
work at least one institution (University X) in Australia where they do
plan to keep metadata about collections (and maybe parties, and so on)
in their IR; they are running the VITAL software which was associated
with the ARROW project. So that's our starting point: a project plan to
write some open source software and supply configuration files and
customisation, and documentation for an ARROW repository so that
University X and other sites running the ARROW suite of software can
participate in the data commons, and submit data to research data
Australia via their IR.</p>
<p>The VITAL software is a web interface to Fedora, with configuration to
index a Fedora repository and display. You can <a href="http://arrow.monash.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Index">see it in
action</a> at the
home of ARROW, Monash University. Some sites use bit of free software
called VALET to put things in to the repository.</p>
<p>VALET has a simple design which I like <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> it allows you to design a form or forms
to capture as much metadata as you like and configure a set of really
simple approval steps. When a user starts adding metadata about a new
object, the system saves the in-progress data by the simple expedient of
serialising the form data to XML. Moving to the next step of a workflow
just requires the application to put the saved data back into the form.
When a user with the correct rights adds the item to the repository,
pre-configured XSLT stylesheets run automatically to transform the
serialised form data to whatever is required, usually MARCXML and Dublin
Core.</p>
<p>The ARROW project sponsored a replacement for VALET called Squire which
<a href="http://ptsefton.com/2008/07/31/improving-valet-part-2.htm">I reported on in
2008</a>, but so
far nobody has used it in anger. For this project I think it might be
good to use Squire, or a something like it rather than VALET; we're
discussing the pros and cons with ANDS and University X.</p>
<p>Over the next week I will be putting together a skeletal draft of a
project plan based around the proposed architecture ready for
stakeholders at ANDS and the IR and eResearch communities to comment now
that people are back from their summer holidays.</p>
<h1><span id="id3"></span></a>Issues</h1>
<p>Some of the things which will need to be resolved are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<hr>
<p>Which OAI-PMH provider to use?</p>
<p>Metadata will get from the VITAL repository to Research Data
Australia via an OAI-PMH feed, but there are a few open source
toolkits to choose from. We will need to support at least one, maybe
more. As ANDS staffer Xiaobin Shen reminded me in the comments of my
last post, one consideration will be whether or not the provider
supports deletions, not all do. This will require careful testing
before we commit to one provider or another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What data model will be used?</strong></p>
<p>At the moment, all the VITAL repositories in Australia that I know
about have a very simple data model. Each item in the repository has
a 'master' metadata record usually in MARCXML, sometimes MODS
(they're effectively the same) with derived metadata in Dublin Core.
There may also be datastreams, usually PDF files. At this stage
there is no formal content model, so the datastreams could be called
anything and it's up to humans to make sense of them; there's no
guaranteed way to tell whether a PDF is an abstract, or the whole
record, a preprint or a published version of a paper, for example.</p>
<p>It's a bit hard to get information about VITAL unless you're a
customer; the <a href="http://www.vtls.com/products/vital">product page</a> is
currently sporting a copyright statement from 2008 and the brochure
(<a href="http://www.vtls.com/media/en-US/brochures/vtls_vital.pdf">PDF</a>) is
big on tropical fish and short on specifications so what I report
here may need correcting.</p>
<p>The version of VITAL which I think most sites are running in
Australia is 3.x. It uses Fedora 2 which doesn't have formal content
models. Fedora 3 has a formal mechanism for describing content
models which means that you could describe the parts of an object,
and their role in the object. From what I can gather VITAL 4 which I
saw demonstrated in late 2008, and was released in March 2009 has
content models too, but they are more about how to display an object
than describing the relations between its parts. Perhaps someone
could elaborate or correct this in the comments?</p>
<p>My working assumption is that for this development, the idea will be
to stick with the way VITAL 3.x works, without worrying about
content modelling which is fine here because this is not about
complex objects with lots of data, it's about metadata about data
collections where the collections themselves will usually reside
elsewhere, which brings us to the sub-question.</p>
<hr>
<p>What goes in the repository and what is stored elsewhere?</p>
<p>There's a real chicken and egg problem here. I gather that
eventually the NLA will be running a party-identifier service based
on People Australia, so when that's established we won't be typing
names into metadata forms any more, we'll be linking to an ID. So in
the abstract model behind RIF-CS the party management just goes
elsewhere. I wonder if the same could happen with activities (every
project has some kind of web site now, so why not point to an RDF
endpoint hosted on the project website or just to the project web
site as an identifier) and services (not sure what to do about
these, but then I'm not really sure yet what services are in this
context).</p>
<p>Question is, if we want to get a system running now, what's the best
way to identify parties in a future-proof way? I discussed a related
issue in a <a href="http://caulcairss.wordpress.com/2009/07/21/nicnames-and-people-australia-some-thoughts-for-cairss/">blog post for CAIRSS about NicNames and People
Australia</a>.
Maybe NicNames can play a role here in the short term?</p>
<p>One of the design patterns I mentioned in that post, using an index
to associate names in a repository with an identity service like
NicNames via an index is expanded in a paper I wrote for the New
Review of Information Networking. At the moment I can only link to
<a href="http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/section?content=a917251410&amp;fulltext=713240928">this
version</a>
which is not open as the publisher has not responded to my questions
about the OA policy so I have yet to deposit a version in Eprints.</p>
</li>
<li>
<hr>
<p>Which metadata format to use?</p>
<p>Scott Yeadon made it clear in the comments to my last post that
RIF-CS was designed as an interchange format only and that it is not
yet stable, which sounds like good reasons not to use it as a
storage format. but I have confirmed reports that others in ANDS are
thinking otherwise, and are encouraging IR managers to put RIF-CS in
the repository; I'd like to hear their side of the story too.
Stability aside, if RIF-CS has what it takes to describe a
collection of data then it might be an OK storage format.</p>
<p>I'm not aware of all the alternatives but one that I have heard
mentioned by and ANDS person is the <a href="http://dublincore.org/groups/collections/collection-application-profile/">Dublin Core Collections
Application
Profile</a>.
What else is out there in use for describing data collections and
are there other data-collections registries harvesting from those
descriptions in the rest of the world?</p>
<p>So this is an open issue for now; I hope we can get some consensus
on a good data model for storing metadata about data collections
(and the other entities).</p>
</li>
<li>
<hr>
<p>What configuration is needed in VITAL? I think we need the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Display for items (are we going to have parties and services and
actions as items as well?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Index configuration for VITAL's Solr Index.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And If the data collection resides in the repository should there be
a collection object <strong>and</strong> a collection-description object or just
one object with both collection and description?</p>
</li>
<li>
<hr>
<p>What kinds of APIs do we need?</p>
<p>VALET can be used to integrate with other systems via XML files
which are deposited in a directory and picked-up by the ingest
workflow of VALET, so they can be curated by data librarians, a
technique which I think was developed by Simon McMillan at UNE in
the RUBRIC days. We can certainly implement this, but should we have
a web (or other) API for a system such as a grants database to add a
new item as well? Should it be AtomPub or a simple post, or SWORD or
something else?</p>

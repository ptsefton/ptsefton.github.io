<p>[This is a re-post. I put this up a couple of days ago but my hosting
provider lost the server for a day and had to restore from backup.]</p>
<p>At the Australian Digital Futures Institute we've landed a contract with
<a href="http://ands.org.au/">ANDS</a> (the Australian National Data Service) to
write some software specifications for key bits of infrastructure for
the data commons. I'm going to be doing most of the initial work on this
one, and I'll use my blog and Twitter to communicate what I'm up to as I
go, as per the communication plan for the project. I know that some of
my regular readers are interested in this stuff.; please comment if you
have anything to add.</p>
<p>This first post will look at the scope of the consultancy, and talk
about some of the major issues that I think we'll need to resolve.</p>
<h1><span id="id2"></span></a>Scope &amp; Deliverables</h1>
<p>Our contract is to p<strong>rovide specifications for software applications to
help institutions manage metadata about data collections and project
plans to build them</strong>. There are two models for these applications. The
first is a stand-alone system, while the second is using the existing
institutional repository to store metadata <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> here's what the project plan says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a name="h5ea3d4bcp1"></a>The proposed [agreed now] process is for
ADFI staff to prepare at least one scoped and costed software
specification, with an agreed development methodology for a:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a name="h7af33813p1"></a>[<span class="spCh spChx2026">…</span>]
standalone metadata store that can be used to augment either an
existing institutional repository or data store, and which will
manage metadata about data objects and data collections. This
metadata will need to complement the existing object-level metadata.
The interface should be designed to be web-based and easy to use by
repository managers without specific technical skills. The metadata
store should be able to generate collection descriptions as RIF-CS
(http://www.globalregistries.org/rifcs.html) and make these
available for harvesting using OAI-PMH and/or direct harvest of XML.</p>
<p>Source: ANDS-internal document.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="h1ec12d8fp1"></a>Additionally we will develop one or more
specifications for providing metadata capture solutions based on
existing institutional repository software.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the main thing we'll be looking at is a kind of repository or
registry-like thing where institutions can describe their data
collections, and publish those descriptions to <a href="http://services.ands.org.au/home/orca/rda/">Research Data
Australia</a>. If you visit
that site you can see the data model that's being used by ANDS with four
classes of thing. Here's <a href="http://services.ands.org.au/home/orca/rda/">a snapshot of how it looks
today</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Collections (877)</p>
<p>Where a collection is a useful grouping of physical or digital items.</p>
<p>Parties (260)</p>
<p>Where a party is a person or organisation that has some relationship
to a collection, service, activity, or party.</p>
<p>Services (1)</p>
<p>Where a service is a mechanism for gaining some kind of access to or
information about a collection (or items within a collection).</p>
<p>Activities (2)</p>
<p>Where an activity is an undertaking or process related to the
creation, update, or maintenance of a collection. [I think projects
are activities - PS]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This model, which is expressed in a schema known as
<a href="http://ands.org.au/resource/rif-cs.html">RIF-CS</a>, is based on a
yet-to-be-approved ISO Standard (ISO2146). RIF-CS implements quite a
different approach from the way most Institutional Repositories (IRs)
are structured, where the repository items themselves are the only
primary objects.</p>
<p>In an IR you typically have metadata which <strong>refers to parties and
services and so on using text-strings</strong>. Parties, services and
activities <strong>are not things</strong> in the repository (speaking in general
here, there are some exceptions, and increasing people have some status
as objects in repositories like Fez). A publisher, which is a party,
will be described in an XML document conforming to some metadata schema
(in Australia this is typically Dublin Core, MODS or MARC XML)<span
style="font-weight:normal; "><span class="T5"> using its name expressed
as a string</span></span>. If two records refer to the same party using
different strings then things start to get messy. And as we all know,
there is one kind of party around which strings proliferate and cause
confusion: people. There is an ANDS effort under way to provide services
for describing people outside of a repository so you can refer to them
using some kind of ID, but that service is a way off still.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.globalregistries.org/rifcs.html">RIF-CS is described here</a>
as an interchange format (it is, after all the The Registry Interchange
Format - Collections and Services) The which I gather was originally
cooked up to support the <a href="http://www.globalregistries.org/">Global Registries
Initiative</a>. But I think some of the
people are thinking of using it as a storage format within repositories.
If we decide do that we will have to do so carefully. For example, you
would not want to store this <a href="http://services.ands.org.au/documentation/rifcs/example/rif.xml">example
RIF-CS</a>
as a single repository object, trust me, as the file contains a number
of things that really should be treated as discrete objects in a
repository, including metadata about people and projects.</p>
<h1><span id="id3"></span></a>Issues for a new standalone metadata store</h1>
<p>If the goal for the standalone metadata store is to support the abstract
model behind RIF-CS then one of the challenges of this project will be
working out how to support this kind of a model. How do make sure that
parties and so on are described once, and as accurately as possible? And
where that fails, make sure there is infrastructure to assert that two
differently described parties are the same, and two identically
described parties are in fact different. If you want to refer to a party
that is not described yet how will we support that? Will people and
objects and so on be primary objects?</p>
<p>In discussions so far, we have tentative agreement between our ANDS
stakeholders and ADFI and on one key point; as far as possible we'd like
the stand-alone metadata store to be Linked (Open) Data ready. This
means that all Collections, Parties, Services and Activities would have
URIs, and the metadata store would allow data entry that uses the URIs
behind the scenes. (I checked with Scott Yeadon at ANDS and he tells me
that RIF-CS 'keys' can be URIs and are expected to be globally unique,
even though this is not entirely clear from the schema documentation).
This is a user interface challenge, but if we can pull it off we should
be able to avoid stuff like this, where a mistyped string results in two
parties where there should be one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://services.ands.org.au/home/orca/rda/list.php?group=&amp;class=Party&amp;page=2">http://services.ands.org.au/home/orca/rda/list.php?group=&amp;class=Party&amp;page=2</a></p>

</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So this is all pointing to a repository which uses RDF to describe
things, drawing on appropriate vocabularies for relations and values,
such as <a href="http://www.foaf-project.org/">FOA</a>F for parties, the
<a href="http://bibliontology.com/">bibliogrpahic ontology</a> for documents, and
maybe the <a href="http://dublincore.org/groups/collections/collection-application-profile/">Dublin Core
Collections</a>
for data collections . We could, of course build a classic
database-backed system with a database schema that reflect the abstract
model directly, but that's very inflexible and not easily extensible.</p>
<p>(We don't have a lot of experience with large-scale RDF at ADFI, but I
am thinking that in addition to the RDF, and a triple store to keep it
in you would probably still have a high performance index of the
repository using Apache Solr to provide the search/browser interface.)</p>
<h1><span id="id4"></span></a>Issues with adapting an IR</h1>
<p>If we work on storing data collection metadata in IRs then there will be
additional challenges. All institutional repositories in Australia
already support Dublin Core metadata, at least in their OAI-PMH feeds.
But a lot of repository software in use in Australia is limited to
storing metadata as plain strings. Because of this, most of the
repository people are used to thinking in terms of flat metadata models
serialised in XML, not networks of relations, RDF style. Anything we do
to augment IR software will have to fit in with the way IRs are used
now, mainly for document content. There are lots of design challenges
there for the information model and user interface. We have started
thinking about this in detail for a particular repository platform at a
particular uni, more on that soon.</p>

<p>Here's another post about the <a href="http://delicious.com/ptsefton/ptsefton+andsmetadatastores">ANDS metadata
store</a> work
I've been doing. I was at the university of Newcastle last week working
with Vicki Picasso and Dave Huthnance, with calls to Teula Morgan at
Swinburne. Together we fleshed-out a model for how Newcastle might run a
data-registry alongside their VITAL repository.</p>
<p>I want to use this blog post to expand on the last blog post and refine
the details of what will become an ANDS project plan for someone to
develop this stuff. I'm going to talk about the <a href="http://ptsefton.com/2010/02/23/ands-metadata-stores-describing-metadata-collections-in-vital.htm">diagram from the last
post</a>,
in particular the application which has become known as <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>The Red Box<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>.</p>
<p><span
style="display: block"><a name="graphics1"></a><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/m117b3490_643x426.jpeg" alt="graphics1"></span></p>
<h1><span id="id2"></span></a>1 Requirements</h1>
<p>The main requirements for this system, as collected from the
stakeholders are that it:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Can provide a <strong>university-wide registry of research data,</strong> (the
data collections will reside wherever they currently reside under
access control, and I believe there is a policy in development that
open data will all be served from the research storage service) with
two main inputs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Form-based deposit, with dead-simple workflow using a system
which is as easy for the library and research office to
customise as the current VALET system, with an option to port
the existing ingest workflows as well (that's why there's a
dotted red line around the current forms system).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discovery of data files and data collections on the university's
new research storage facility.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work alongside of the VITAL institutional repository by storing
metadata (and potentially small collections themselves) in Fedora,
which is the underlying storage layer for VITAL</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>VITAL can be used as the portal for access to research
collection metadata or not</strong>, as appropriate. Teula Morgan told
us that at Swinburne they would likely connect the research data
collections into their discovery layer rather than using VITAL.
The following models need to be supported:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>VITAL as the authoritative source for digital objects, with
RedBox deleting objects which it has handed off to VITAL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RedBox as the authoritative source for digital objects, with
VITAL or another portal acting as the discovery interface
for research data collections. With the addition of a
portal, this configuration could form the basis of a
standalone metadata store.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The system needs to <strong>stay out of VITAL's way as much as
possible</strong> to avoid the risk of unapproved material 'leaking'
through VITAL and to avoid affecting performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The system should provide for batch-changes to repository
content</strong>, in order to assist in cleaning up the document data
that is already in there prior to adding research data. (This
component came up both in discussions about how we can work in a
linked-data way <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> adding
URIs for people mentioned in the repository and as a requirement
from Swinburne where they lament the lack of batch-editing tools
in VITAL).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The system needs to have <strong>no dependencies on the proprietary
parts of VITAL</strong>, to allow the possibility of switching
repositories.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>As far as possible <strong>deal only with the collections side of
things</strong>, without attempting to become management system for
activities (research projects) or parties (people). Following from
this, to be a <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>Linked Data<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> application where Activities and
Parties are referred to by URIs, and other terms also use
well-define URIs rather than strings. (There is a potential
side-project to this one to upgrade the NicNames system <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> more on that soon).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Caroline Drury the CAIRSS/ANDS liaison person pointed out that we should
discuss how these requirements go beyond encouraging people to register
data via the ANDS 'register my data' service for Research Data
Australia. The big things are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>This allows an institution to have additional management metadata
that is not in the RDA system, such as details of how long data
should be held. We're working with Simon Porter from the University
of Melbourne on this. The idea as that when this is implemented with
University X they will work out the metadata they need and the
developer would assist in creating the input forms and mappings from
one metadata format to another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This provides for curation by a data librarians who can leave some
submissions in the queue while they sort out details of the metadata
or wait for data to be made available on the storage facility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This also encompasses data which is not destined for or not ready
for listing on RDA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But most importantly it will allow the institution to meet its
obligations under <a href="http://ands.org.au/resource/code.html">The Code.</a></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1><span id="id4"></span></a>2 Implementation</h1>
<p>The deliverable for the work we're doing at USQ for ANDS is an ANDS
project plan. That makes sense, as it makes starting up the next phase
of work straightforward. But to put forward a complete plan, we need to
make some assumptions about the design, mainly in what technologies we
would use. So here's a proposed broad-brush architecture for a metadata
stores solution work with VITAL. Remember this is only a proposal an the
reason it's up on this blog is so you can comment on it.</p>
<p>The large-scale assumptions are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>RedBox will use <strong>Fedora 3 as an internal storage component <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span></strong> with data synchronised to VITAL as
needed. This meets the requirement that VITAL is functioning as a
portal and will reduce stress on the VITAL repository as much as
possible. Fedora is an obvious choice for ARROW/VITAL sites. We are
choosing to work with the latest version for the RedBox component,
but it will need to synchronise with Fedora 2 which underpins the
VITAL product.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The application will be <strong>developed in Java,</strong> building on The
Fascinator platform which was originally sponsored by the ARROW
project in 2008 and which has been under development at USQ since
then. Benefits include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Being Java it can sit in the same Tomcat web-server as Fedora
and the Apache Solr indexer used by most Fedora repositories
these days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ingest component we're developing for The Fascinator, while
incomplete, meets the requirement that the system be
configurable in a similar way to VALET <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> where extending the forms and
integrating them with external systems like CrossRef is
trivially easy. Existing VALET forms can also be ported to the
new system (it's a manual process, but not difficult).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's highly modular and so can be used, for example, without a
portal, a role which VITAL, or a discovery service can take on.
One of the most important modules will be plugin harvest
technology to pick up content that's on the storage system and
provide a view to researchers and data librarians to begin
describing it. The Fascinator has as extensible system of
plugins and we already have file-indexers and a framework for
extracting metadata from files, which can be extended to work
with new kinds of research data as they appear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our developers know the system, meaning we can be up and running
with this application very quickly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We are aware of other Fedora software components, but none that meet
all of the above criteria. The closest would probably be Muradora
<span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> if there are ANDS contributors
using that who want help setting it for research data then I think
that would be in scope for us to look at in our ANDS work,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While there was some discussion about using VALET or VITAL as the
foundation for the RedBox early in the project neither of these
systems has an architecture which can work on a university-wide
scale if all data sets are to be described, or the ability to
harvest metadata about files on the research storage service.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2><span id="id6"></span></a>2.1 Components</h2>
<p>I'll take a brief look at some of the components in turn.</p>
<h3><span id="id7"></span></a>2.1.1 Batch editing</h3>
<p>The Fascinator already has the basis for a batch-change tool. The
Fascinator, whether it is sitting on top of Fedora or our simple file
back-end has indexer component which can either watch a queue for
changes in a repository or do a complete re-index.</p>
<p>This indexer has an extensible set of rules which are small scripts that
can be fired off to deal with various kinds of content. In our desktop
work we use this for things like generating web-ready versions of video
content and HTML versions of documents, but it could also be used to
transform datastreams in the repository to make bulk changes.</p>
<p>Here's an example of how it might be used. I talked previously about
setting up a system with the NLA or locally using NicNames to assign
unique IDs to researchers before we start the major part of this
project. Once we had a set of name identities, they could be put back
into the repository by writing an 'indexing' rule that for each document
does a look up to the name authority system and puts it back into the
MARCXML datastream in an appropriate field. Then you tell the system to
re-index.</p>
<p>For a batch edit, you'd back everything up, then set this up and run it
on a copy of the repository and swap in the new data and test thoroughly
with VITAL, before either running the process on the live repository or
swapping in a new Fedora database underneath.</p>
<h3><span id="id8"></span></a>2.1.2 OAI-PMH feeds</h3>
<p>One of the key deliverables for this project is to get data flowing to
<a href="http://services.ands.org.au/home/orca/rda/">Research Data Australia</a>.
Part of the project scope will be to make sure that we have
fully-functional OAI-PMH feeds, complete with support for deletions,
working from both VITAL's copy of Fedora and from the RedBox itself to
meet the requirement that the system is able to run in <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>headless<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> mode. Xiaobin Shen from ANDS in
Melbourne has been working with OAI-PMH providers, so we don't expect
this part to be hard., just a matter of careful selection, configuration
and testing.</p>
<h3><span id="id9"></span></a>2.1.3 VITAL configuration</h3>
<p>One of the major tasks is to create customisations for VITAL to display
metadata records about data and make sure that the result fits in to the
rest of the VITAL repository portal.</p>
<h3><span id="id10"></span></a>2.1.4 The Forms interface</h3>
<p>While we're not proposing to use the Squire forms interface sponsored by
ARROW directly, the code we will be using is based on and informed by
the same VALET model. This system consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Form-templates using the same Velocity template engine for Java as
VITAL uses, to make this easy to deploy for ARROW sites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Form widgets that allow for linked-data lookups. The idea will be to
use sources such as People Australia or a NicNames instance to
provide a URI for a name; type in <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>John Smith<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> and it will give you a list of John
Smiths and the areas in which they work to pick from, with similar
lookups for research projects. Where there is no suitable John Smith
then the forms application will create a new one with a temporary
URI via a call to the name-authority.</p>
<p>Another thing the ingest system will need is a link to the Identify
My Data service or a local equivalent for those sites who are sold
on the benefits of using Handles as persistent identifiers for their
collections<span class="footnote"
style="vertical-align: super;"><a href="#ftn0" title="1 I'm not convinced that using the ANDS handle infrastructure is a good idea. Firstly, ANDS is only funded for a short time and while ANDS staff express their aspirations for keeping things going there are no guarantees, secondly, data has to have URL pointing to where it is stored, and that has to be maintained as well, with redirects and so when things change. In a lot of use-cases I think that using Handles just increases complexity, cost and risk.">1</a></span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simple workflow descriptions like the following sample:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<p>&quot;stages&quot;: [</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>&quot;name&quot;: &quot;init&quot;,</p>
<p>&quot;security&quot;: [&quot;owner&quot;, &quot;admin&quot;],</p>
<p>&quot;visibility&quot;: [&quot;guest&quot;, &quot;owner&quot;, &quot;admin&quot;],</p>
<p>&quot;template&quot;: &quot;${user.home}/.fascinator/workflows/templates/basic-init.vm&quot;</p>
<p>},</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>&quot;name&quot;: &quot;live&quot;,</p>
<p>&quot;security&quot;: [&quot;owner&quot;, &quot;admin&quot;],</p>
<p>&quot;visibility&quot;: [&quot;guest&quot;, &quot;owner&quot;, &quot;admin&quot;],</p>
<p>&quot;template&quot;: &quot;${user.home}/.fascinator/workflows/templates/basic-live.vm&quot;</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>]</p>
<h3><span id="id12"></span></a>2.1.5 Research storage harvest &amp; grants database triggers</h3>
<p>The University of Newcastle has a research storage facility (a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storage_area_network">SAN</a>) and policies
are under development which will likely see lots of RDA-ready data made
available on the facility. One of the features of the RedBox application
will be to he able to harvest metadata about such files; at the very
least, file-paths, sizes and dates, and any other metadata that can be
automatically extracted. For data that's on the storage facility the
idea is that researchers can add it to the metadata store by finding the
data files themselves and clicking <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>Describe this data<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> to fill out a form.</p>
<p>The Fascinator has a number of features in this area such as the ability
to generate thumbnail versions of files and web-ready renditions of
various formats, which is of peripheral interest to the metadata stores
activity.</p>
<p>The harvester system is highly configurable, so it could be set up to
index, or watch other kinds of storage service; one that Newcastle
require is the ability to harvest an email account with messages from
the grants database about grant completions; which are events that
should trigger a metadata librarian to chase-up data from researchers.</p>
<h1><span id="id13"></span></a>3 Risks</h1>
<p>There will be a detailed risk assessment for ANDS, but here are some
notes about the main risks:</p>
<div class="Risks"
style="width: 100%; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; text-align:left;">
<p>+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Risk                                                                     |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| The software we develop here might end up being only used at one or a    |
| handful of institutions, which would then bear the maintenance load.     |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| University X unable to supply full metadata schema on time; there is no  |
| clear consensus on best practice for describing research data collection |
| to meet the demands of The Code, while being able to serve RIF-CS to     |
| Research Data Australia.                                                 |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Linked Data infrastructure including URI endpoints for parties and       |
| activities doesn't come on-line in time for implementation               |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+</p>

<p>It's been quite a while since I have looked at word processing here.
Over the next couple of weeks I'm going to revisit some of the ongoing
themes I cover on this blog about document formats and <a href="http://delicious.com/ptsefton/scholarlyhtml">Scholarly
HTML</a> and so on, working
with my colleague Ron <span class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>If The
Encodings Don't Get You The Namespaces Will<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> Ward, a veteran word processor wrangler,
the man who wrote most of the rendering and conversion code in the ICE
application. (I'm still working on the <a href="http://delicious.com/ptsefton/andsmetadatastores">metadata
stores</a> thing, too).</p>
<p>So, in no particular order, some things we're going to look at.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I'll come back to the wonderful world of Custom XML in Word 2007,
<a href="http://ptsefton.com/2009/12/23/bye-bye-word-2007-custom-xml.htm">which may be a
ex-feature</a>,
and the work that Microsoft Research did on various authoring
plugins that used it, and try to find out what's happening there. We
have a visitor coming this week who worked with MS Research on their
ontology plugin. More about that soon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I'm going to revisit the Word 2007 interface, which frankly still
frightens me, I dread that process of hunting through weird
interface widgets for something I used to know how to do in muscle
memory.<span class="footnote"
style="vertical-align: super;"><a href="#ftn1" title="1 Look, I'm not afraid of learning new things, why at the moment I'm more or less   learning to play the mandolin which is tuned in 5th s rather than 4th s like most of a guitar – that's a whole lot of new fingerings, but it makes sense  and it's fun.">1</a></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interop between Microsoft Word 2007 and Openoffice across .<code>doc</code>,
<code>.docx</code> and <code>.odt</code>. This is not just a technical issue, there's
politics involved. For instance I think,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_microsystems">Sun</a>'s evangelical
policy used to be <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>Over our dead
body will Writer save into that filthy Microsoft .docx format,
although we will let you read it in, in order that your documents
might be saved.<span class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> (That's <em>saved</em>
as in saved from eternal damnation <em>as well as</em> saved in the one
true open format). Dear
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Ellison">Larry</a>, we have the
dead body part, can we have Save as <span
class="spCh spChx2026">…</span> .docx now<span class="footnote"
style="vertical-align: super;"><a href="#ftn0" title="2 Yes I can save as .docx here in Ubuntu, but that's a special build with some Novell code in it, I believe.">2</a></span>?</p>
<p>Closer to home there are political issues at USQ with ICE and how it
works with some classes of documents. Over in the Faculty of
Engineering I gather people are being forced to use ICE for
maths-heavy courses, Bron Chandler has been working hard to help the
course-maintainers in engineering, to find an acceptable way for
them to use Word or Writer plus ICE but there <em>are</em> limits to how
far we can push these word processors for heavy duty technical
documents. I'll say it again: I don't think it makes sense to
mandate the use of a tool like ICE at a university; we should talk
about performance based standards for materials and remain
pragmatic; if we can't find a cheap way to make HTML versions of
maths-heavy materials then we may have to settle for PDF and we may
have to let people use LaTeX, or DocBook or whatever (I've never
heard of one wanting to use DocBook but there are plenty of LaTeX
enthusiasts).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ron is going to look at how we might be able to use Word instead of
or in addition to OpenOffice.org in ICE. We picked OpenOffice.org as
the main engine-room for ICE several years ago because it is
available cross-platform but what if we could do one or more of the
following on Windows?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use Word to generate PDF <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span>
should improve the WYSIWYG fidelity (Ron's already got this
automated, although not hooked in to ICE yet.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use Word rather than OpenOffice to render the image parts of a
page, again to improve the way things look. ICE uses a two-part
process to convert to HTML. It converts OpenDocument format XML
into HTML, but to get images such as charts or equations, it
also calls OpenOffice's Save as HTML feature (initial
experiments look promising).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe replace OpenOffice.org altogether on Windows by automating
it to save as .odt behind the scenes. (If that works, there is
still the issue of how to make books out of individual course
documents. At them moment this I a very complex process which
automates Writer, as the master document feature doesn't work
for what we want.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And if the above fails, maybe rewrite the ICE renderer for
Office Open XML rather than Open Document Format. Big job we'd
rather not have to resource.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Along the way, this is going to force me to spend some time in Windows
for the first time in a long time, guess I'll have a chance to learn
about Windows 7.</p>

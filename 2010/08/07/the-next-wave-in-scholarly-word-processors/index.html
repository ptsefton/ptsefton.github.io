<p>This post is about the past, the present and the future, and also about
word processors, PDF and that doomed Google Wave thing <a href="http://delicious.com/ptsefton/ptsefton+googlewave"><span>about
which I have written a few
posts</span></a>.</p>
<h1><span id="id2"></span><span></span></a>Wave bye bye to the future</h1>
<p>Cameron Neylon has posted <a href="http://cameronneylon.net/blog/the-triumph-of-document-layout-and-the-demise-of-google-wave/"><span>some reflections on the impending
demise of Google
Wave</span></a>,
in which he saw great promise for the future of the dynamic scientific
document, or whatever you call it. Document's probably not the right
word for what Wave did, and it's not clear how document-like future
scientific outputs will be. The start of his post is a lament about PDF
and its constraints on scientific discourse; we're on the same page
there. Wave, on the other hand, was dynamic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The key for me about the promise of Wave was its ability to interact
with web based functionality, to be dynamic; fundamentally to treat a
growing document as data and present that data in new and interesting
ways. In the end this was probably just too abstruse a concept to grab
hold of a user. While single demonstrations were easy to put together,
building graphs, showing chemistry, marking up text, it was the bigger
picture that this was generally possible that never made it through.</p>
<p><a href="http://cameronneylon.net/blog/the-triumph-of-document-layout-and-the-demise-of-google-wave/"><span>http://cameronneylon.net/blog/the-triumph-of-document-layout-and-the-demise-of-google-wave/</span></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Me, I won't miss Wave. I liked the idea of the document as a dynamic
thing to which many parties could contribute, and I liked the way
dynamic stuff could be plugged in. The dynamic parts were not all that
much different to the OLE embedding that's been in Word processors for
years, just repackaged for the web, but the idea of massively parallel
editing by people and machines was exciting. What I didn't like was that
Wave was actually a time-ordered conversation. You could branch the
conversation at any point, as with a threaded discussion, but
re-ordering was impossible. What I wanted to see, and still want was
something with Wave-like collaboration but with well-structured HTML
documents underneath. I'm with Cameron Neylon in thinking that we'll
eventually figure out how to make these beautiful to behold (and
<strong>hold</strong> <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> iPad style) and use and
interact with.</p>
<p>I'll return to this at the end of this document,</p>
<p>Now to a contemporary critique of the past.</p>
<h1><span id="id3"></span><span></span></a>The present: word processors are (according to Sam) evil</h1>
<p>In the past I have spent a lot of time and effort working on publishing
systems for 'ordinary' users, focusing on word processor-driven web
publishing. The latest of these, the <a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/"><span>Integrated Content
Environmen</span></a>t (ICE) is a core system at
the University of Southern Queensland. I'm used to debating this core
design choice of a word processor as an editing tool, and explaining
over and over again why we chose Word and OpenOffice.org as the editors
for our hundreds of users.</p>
<p>Actually, we didn't choose.</p>
<p><strong>They</strong> chose. The users did.</p>
<p>Give them anything else with which to edit a long document and a
significant percentage of contemporary academics will type it up in
Word, or increasingly Google Docs. A smaller percentage will type it up
in any old text editor with LaTeX markup, and some other small
percentage will use an HTML editor. Some gulp down the WordPress
panacea.</p>
<p>Enter Sam Moffat, who works in the same division of the university as
me, as a programmer, with his short piece: <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span><a href="http://pasamio.com/2010/07/21/the-evils-of-a-word-processor/#more-669"><span>The evils of a word
processo</span></a>r<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>. Sam reports that his mother is having
difficulty with her word processor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I<span class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>m observing my mother fight with
Word. To make things complicated she<span
class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>s copy and pasting items from a PDF.</p>
<p><a href="http://pasamio.com/2010/07/21/the-evils-of-a-word-processor/#more-669"><span>http://pasamio.com/2010/07/21/the-evils-of-a-word-processor/#more-669</span></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The way I read this situation is that <strong>the culprit here is actually
PDF</strong> not the word processor. PDF was designed to drive printers and to
make it easy for publishers to lock documents to a particular set of
formatting choices. Yes, I know PDF can be elegantly structured <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> but you know it rarely is. This is
similar to what Cameron Neylon's saying; PDF constrains us. Pasting PDF
into just about anything is going to be a hassle. (You did show mum how
to paste-special as plain text, didn't you Sam?)</p>
<p>Sam's right, we do need to help our users get on with thinking about
what they're writing and editing, and free them from the struggle to
format things. And you know what? That's the intent of the ICE system;
it uses styles in the word processor with an easy-to-use toolbar to
apply them, and ICE users soon become comfortable with the way they can
create a single source document <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> we
don't turn off the other features of the word processor but we do try to
wean people off them. But Sam's wrong about one thing, we don't 'trash'
the formatting (see the next quote), we use the WYSIWYG word processor
view of the document to make PDF. Why? Because that's a cheap way to
render documents where all the disciplines and not a few of the people
have special requirements.</p>
<p>It is nice to see that our programmers are thinking about the
big-picture, productivity and the utility of our tools:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I ponder this at times when the USQ course material publishing system
went from a semantic based system into a system driven by
OpenOffice.org and Word. I wonder just how much time our academics
waste trying to get the format right when eventually it probably is
going to be trashed anyway?</p>
<p><a href="http://pasamio.com/2010/07/21/the-evils-of-a-word-processor/#more-669"><span>http://pasamio.com/2010/07/21/the-evils-of-a-word-processor/#more-669</span></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>My judgement is that right now using a word processor to produce our
single-source print and web materials probably wastes the least amount
of time overall, taking into account the academics, support staff,
trainers, systems developers, materials managers, publishing services
people and so on, but I'm always on the look out for alternatives. We're
exploring this as we consider what version three of ICE might look like.
A SharePoint plugin? Part of a repository of quality-assured courseware?
A Word Add-in?</p>
<p>One things is for certain, Wave wasn't it, and neither was a
heavy-weight 'semantic' XML publishing system. We tried that.</p>
<h1><span id="id4"></span><span></span></a>The past: Why did USQ leave behind the 'semantic' publishing system?</h1>
<p>Sam wonders about the demise of USQ's XML based 'semantic' publishing
system.</p>
<p>It was called GOOD, but most of the academics regarded it as anything
but. It came with an XML editor which was very complicated to use, not
to mention hundreds of dollars per seat to license. There was very
widespread resistance to its rollout. I remember the lead developer
attempting to show me how he used it for the system's own documentation
and giving up in frustration 'cos he couldn't really make the editor
work. I also remember playing with it and trying to split a too-long
section of text into two parts, with a sub-heading. That's actually
quite the gymnastic performance in a validating editor; creating a new
section, getting the heading in the right element, moving the text,
unless you know the tricks. Easy to do in a word processor, though, just
whack in in a paragraph where you choose, and style it as a heading,
relying on the well known fact that both machines and people can infer a
perfectly good hierarchical document structure from cues given by
different levels of heading <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> even
if the headings are, <em>gasp</em>, put into table for formatting reasons..</p>
<p>And why am I putting those scare quotes around 'semantic'?</p>
<p>Well, there was the sad case of <em>work.title</em>. In GOOD, as in all good
semantically-oriented publishing systems there was a plentiful supply of
elements for describing things independently of the formatting used to
display them in various media. GOOD had lots of ways of marking up stuff
like the titles of works (someone wanted an element for the names of
marine vessels, not sure if they got it <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> there were a lot of various expensive
conversations about that kind of thing) and various kinds of emphasis.
As you'd expect, more than one of these important semantic elements was
rendered as italic in print. What happened was, the publishing services
team, who worked on other people's manuscripts and wanted to get things
<strong>done</strong> started using <code>work.title</code> for all italic formatting whether it
was for the title of a work or for emphasis, or the name of a sailing
ship. By the time people on the XML project team noticed, and more
expensive meetings were held and so on, the only sensible thing to do
was to batch-update all the documents so the polluted 'semantic' element
became, you know, <code>&lt;italic&gt;</code>. (<strong>NOTE:</strong> this is from memory so the
exact element names may be a bit wrong, but the story is true.)</p>
<p>In ICE we sidestepped this problem and we use the core inline HTML
elements &lt;i&gt; and &lt;b&gt;. But, if ships are important to you then you
can define a style i-i-frigate and format it how you like in your word
processor, and ICE will give you <code>&lt;i class=”frigate”&gt; … &lt;/i&gt;</code>. Guess
what? Nobody does that.</p>
<p>Sam concludes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a LaTeX user, this is food for thought.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Um, right. LaTeX. I'm not sure what he's getting at here, as LaTeX is
only semi-semantic and is often not really re-usable outside of the
author's home directory.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we haven't had much luck getting a LaTeX editing system
that can produce both PDF and HTML for more than one person's output.
Surprisingly there is no general purpose LaTeX to HTML converter on the
web. I checked. More than once. And there is apparently no on-campus
LaTeX user with the tenacity to (a) come up with a generically useful
set of templates and (b) convince a community of others to all do things
the same way. The quite tenacious Bron Chandler keeps trying to make
this happen, though she's not a LaTeX user, working with a few of the
less foaming-at-the mouth LaTeX users. Maybe Sam can help.</p>
<h1><span id="id5"></span><span></span></a>The future</h1>
<p>Cameron Neylon liked Wave because it was not about formatting, and it
was dynamic. I hated that it was not actually properly 'of the web' and
it didn't make web documents; what I think we need in scholarship is
<strong>the web, but editable</strong>, with ways to hook-in dynamic processes and
declarative datasets that do interesting things when the dynamic
processes get to them.</p>
<p>The good news is that Ron Ward, from our team at ADFI has been thinking
deeply about this for a long time, and last week when the team had a
'choose your own adventure' innovation week, he chose to work on a
pure-JavaScript in-browser editor. I know what you're thinking <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> there are tons of those already. Not so,
according to Ron. Most of the editors you'll be thinking of are either
not HTML editors (like Google Docs and Wave) or are using the in-built
browser editing components. What Ron looked at was a real-life from the
ground up 'line editor' for HTML something which apparently is widely
regarded as being too slow and too hard. He had to build things from the
blinking cursor up and did a remarkable job in a couple of days.
Performance seems fine, and we're all really excited about the
possibilities.</p>
<p>Ron's editor lets you click in an HTML paragraph, type away, changing
the actual documents as you go . This real-live HTML has some
interesting features. Type multiple spaces, for example and you only get
one 'cos that's how browsers render space. The test rig is set up to
capture editing events and replay them, opening up lots of possibilities
for Wave-style time-slider interfaces so you can watch the evolution of
a document.</p>
<p>Ron points out that parallel editing is not going to be that hard to do,
if you set it up so multiple people can load the page at the same time.
I haven't looked, but it could be that some of the theory behind Wave
and some of the messaging framework might be useful here.</p>
<p>Ron's editor thing is really just a proof of concept at this stage, but
things to explore include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Building-up the editor until it has an ICE-style toolbar like the
one I'm using to write this document:</p>
<p><a name="graphics1"><span></span></a><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/m7a08eced_396x18.jpeg" alt="graphics1"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hook it up to our<a href="https://fascinator.usq.edu.au/trac/wiki/Annotate"><span> Anotar annotations
framework</span></a>
so document-deltas can be stored as stand-off annotations. And there
are conversations to have with Stijn Dekeser in USQ Maths and
Computing, who researches in this area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Package it as an HTML 5 app to make a lightweight note taking thing
for mobile devices.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll ask Ron to add a link to a demo/wiki here in the comments ASAP.</p>

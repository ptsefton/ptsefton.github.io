<p>Which sounds like a good idea for documents <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> getting all those formats for free,
right?</p>
<p>It is, but you have to take into account the cost of creating the
documents, inducing the authors to capture the semantics, and providing
tools for authors that they will actually use. (And keep in mind that a
lot of those output formats are actually HTML based: HTML, XTHML, ePub
HTML help, more on that later).</p>
<p>Back in 2004 I used the analogy that <a href="http://ptsefton.com/blog/2004/05/03/potentialenergy/"><span>XML is like a
hill</span></a> <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> and <a href="http://ptsefton.com/blog/2004/07/29/xml_as_hill_2/"><span>presented that idea at Open
Publish</span></a>. The
message was that if you manage to climb up high enough then generating
output formats like HTML is a downhill slide. (Or a semantically rich
document is like a tightly wound spring, ready to unleash its stored
energy).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The XML as hill metaphor, together with the author as cyclist
metaphor</em> to talk about the importance of picking the right tool, and
the right template/schema for your authors. You can get them to pedal
up hill (ie encode potential energy into their documents) if they get
a small reward; a downhill coast. That is, they will follow a standard
if they can see the point, such as a web-site of their course building
before their eyes. They will not cooperate if you ask them to climb
too steep a hill for no apparent reason.</p>

<p><a href="http://ptsefton.com/2010/08/07/the-next-wave-in-scholarly-word-processors.htm"><span>As I noted in my last post, when USQ tried to get academics to
climb a steep hill with the GOOD system, they simply wouldn't do
it</span></a>
(and nor would I have). We ended up with a system with a much flatter
gradient, <a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/"><span>ICE</span></a>.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Now, the promised long answer.</p>
<h1><span id="id4"></span><span></span></a>The facts</h1>
<p>ICE templates can be used to make DocBook documents. Dr Ian Barnes did
the work for this back when he was with the Australian Partnership for
Digital Repositories, <a href="http://apsr.edu.au/"><span>APSR</span></a> for a
project called <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span><a href="http://www.apsr.edu.au/word/"><span>Digital
Scholar's Workbench</span></a><span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>. The final report <a href="http://www.apsr.edu.au/word/workbench_final_report.pdf"><span>gives some more
detail</span></a>,
including future plans for development that didn't happen.</p>
<p>Ian wrote fiendishly complicated XSLT stylesheets that could turn open
office documents (and by extension Word documents loaded via Open
Office) into DocBook <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> assuming the
use of a set of styles, which is where ICE came in.</p>
<p>There have been other systems that attempt to use word processor styles
to create DocBook documents, notably a software application of legend
from O'Reilly called Aardvaark which I <a href="http://ptsefton.com/blog/2006/02/13/ice:_content_management_with_a_long_tongue/"><span>wrote about
here</span></a><span
class="footnote"
style="vertical-align: super;"><a href="#ftn1" title="1 That post is why one of the most popular search strings that brings people to my blog is “long tongue” and variants thereof. Oops I did it again, frustrating the people who really want a longer tongue or want to look at pictures of other people with long tongues, maybe both. If I ever get sick of discussions about metadata or whether WordPress is a good tool for writing a PhD I'm definitely going to write a guide to longer tongues. Who knows, maybe O'Reilly will publish it with an aadrvark on the cover. I am an O'Reilly author you know. I have a photocopy of a cheque signed by Tim himself here in my office for   FOUR HUNDRED AND 0/100 DOLLARS. They didn't make me write in DocBook, though,   for my XML.com articles, they wanted HTML. Just saying."><span>1</span></a></span>.
You can find other half-hearted attempts littered around the web.</p>
<h1><span id="id5"></span><span></span></a>My opinion</h1>
<p>So having answered the question <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>can
you<span class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> with a yes, I want to say,
<span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span><strong>but don't</strong><span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>.</p>
<p>If you have a set of word processing documents that have enough
structure in the form of Headings etc to even consider something like
DocBook as a format then you can use ICE or an equivalent system (if
such a thing exists) to:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Make PDFs</strong> of them and push them out on the web by using the word
processor to make the PDF <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> no
loss of formatting as you try to deal with edge cases that might not
fit into DocBook. (One of the things that Ian had trouble dealing
with is that lots of word processing documents use a mixture of
numbered and not-numbered headings. That's a no-no in DocBook.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Turn them into HTML</strong> and weave them into the fabric of the
<strong>web</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make <strong>other formats as required</strong>: eg ePub for mobile use, IMS
packages for educational use. (Both of these are HTML derivatives).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Some kind of package format</strong> for deposit in a repository with
HTML, PDF and the rest. (This is work in progress, but DocBook won't
help).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Given that both Word and OpenOffice.org now use well-specified XML based
formats bundled in Zip files, I would assume that the range of formats
mentioned above takes care of preservation. What else is DocBook going
to give you?</p>
<p>The one thing I can see is that DocBook can be turned into PDF using
standard, free, tools. That's reasonable, you might want to use it as
part of a rendering system. But don't forget you'll be dealing with all
the things that might be embedded in those word processing documents,
charts, diagrams, complex tables with very important formatting like
double borders in the right places, and best of all, <strong>maths</strong>. Sure,
DocBook can do mathematical typesetting, but you have to get all the
maths out of the word processing docs and into DocBook you have to get
it <strong>right</strong>. This is hard and there are no right answers, only
compromises. My team at ADFI continue to work on these compromises for
the Integrated Content Environment,
<a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/"><span>ICE</span></a>.</p>
<h1><span id="id6"></span><span></span></a>You get what you pay for / get back the effort you put in</h1>
<p>But wait! I can hear you saying, DocBook is much richer than HTML!</p>
<p>So it is. But in my considerable experience, the sweet-spot for using a
word processor is around the use of headings to create a document
outline, some sanity in lists using our very carefully designed set of
styles, plus blockquotes, preformat text. That's about the extent of
what you can collect from large groups of authors who are not obsessed
with document structure and semantics. Go after those simple things and
you will get usable documents. Go after something that attempts to layer
a few hundred elements of DTD over a flat word processor document and
you'll get nothing, as in nobody will comply and you will have to add
all the structure to the DocBook later. That's fine if you have the
business case for such activities. I know I don't.</p>
<p>If you want to do more than simple basic structure then a word processor
is not the right tool, you might as well use an XML editor.</p>
<p>But then you won't get a large general user base using an XML editor.</p>
<p>At this point we have come full circle so I'll leave it at this. Word
processors are good for capturing simple structure and semantics and
that turns out to be all you need in many cases. If you do want more
then HTML has a way to do semantic extensions. It's called the class
attribute. (And we're exploring ways that more semantics might be
layered into Word processing documents using a kind of word processor
equivalent to RDFa).</p>
<p>But I <strong>still</strong> want DocBook!</p>
<p>Like I just said, the structure you get from an ICE-like word processor
document after it has been converted into DocBook is <strong>exactly</strong> the
same level of complexity as the HTML we generate from ICE: Headings,
lists , quotes, preformat.</p>
<p>For the final word on why you don't need DocBook, I refer you to Mark
Pilgrim who authored a <a href="http://diveintopython.org/"><span>wonderful book in
DocBook</span></a> but <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2009/03/27/dive-into-history-2009-edition"><span>abandoned the
DocBook format for plain-old HTML in the latest
edition</span></a>.</p>
<h1><span id="id7"></span><span></span></a>Summary</h1>
<p>So, the main points I have made are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Yes you can make a kind of cut-price DocBook from ICE, or any
reasonably structured word processing file, but it won't be getting
the best out of DocBook.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In situations where source documents come from word processors I
don't see the point in adding another format to the tool-chain
unless you (a) really need to produce PDF in a variety of formats
from the source text (rather than just automating a 'Save as PDF' or
(b) you are going to add value by using DocBook or similar later in
the editorial process and you have the resources.</p>
<p>But note that there are other options for generating PDF/Print from
HTML including HTML to PDF XSL-FO stylesheets or using (non-free)
<a href="http://www.princexml.com/"><span>Prince</span></a>. I predict that
this will be a continued growth area.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But, If Anthony Hornby really wants to have DocBook, and I suspect he
does, then what could he do?</p>
<p>Me, I'd talk to Ian Barnes, who is now residing in Scotland and <strong>is
available to consult and/or program</strong> <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> he's the localhworld expert on
ICE-to-DocBook and has explored many of the options for rendering to PDF
(including from HTML).</p>

<p>In this post I want to look at what makes the various kinds of <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>Open<span class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>
tick.</p>
<p>Open CourseWare, Creative Commons, Open Source and Free Software are all
frameworks for sharing various kinds of information-artefacts. (Open
standards is a different kind of thing, which I won't be talking about
here.) This is a different slant on the debate than <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>Here's why open is good<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> . I want to review: <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>What is this open?<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>. As with another recent <a href="http://ptsefton.com/2010/08/12/my-fave-two-reasons-not-to-release-opencourseware.htm"><span>post
debunking reasons not to go
open</span></a>,
I wrote this to help get my thoughts in order ready for Michael Sankey's
OCW 'summit' which took place yesterday. There is some action on the
long-stalled Open Courseware effort at USQ, and it's really exciting but
it's not up to me to announce it, so I'll stick to theorising and
opining.</p>
<p>I'll look at the backbone of the various kinds of 'open', then look at
what I think some of the opportunities are from where I'm sitting.</p>
<p>Where am I sitting, you ask?</p>
<p>Y-block at the University of Southern Queensland's Toowoomba Campus,
looking out towards the Japanese Gardens.</p>
<p>Why is this relevant?</p>
<p>OK, the gardens aren't. But Y-block is where the Distance and eLearning
Centre resides, and where my team has its roots. The Distance and
eLearning part is important. USQ is a distance-learning provider of some
note, and as such has a rich collection of distance materials suitable
for independent and isolated learners to study. Don't get me wrong, USQ
does offer a very high-touch service to its off campus students, and not
all courses are built around self-paced learning materials (which is
<a href="http://ptsefton.com/2010/08/12/my-fave-two-reasons-not-to-release-opencourseware.htm"><span>why the 'business' won't come to an
end</span></a>
if we release open courseware) but the distance-ready materials are a
key asset.</p>

<h1><span id="id2"></span><span></span></a>Fundamentals It's about <span class="spCh spChxa9">©</span> licenses</h1>
<p>What's the foundation for these frameworks for sharing? This might be
counter-intuitive to some, but it's the same thing as drives the
sometimes brutal and voracious publishing, film, music and commercial
software industries.</p>
<p><strong>Copyright<span class="footnote"
style="vertical-align: super;"><a href="#ftn1" title="1The software industry also involves patent law, too but we'll leave that one alone."><span>1</span></a></span></strong>
<strong>law</strong> makes 'the opens' work.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman"><span>Richard Stallman
</span></a>invented open
licensing when he created the GNU General Public
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html"><span>License</span></a> (GPL).
Stallman showed how to create a mechanism for distribution of copyright
works that guaranteed that the works would be accessible-to and
usable-by other people. The key trick was to use the power vested in a
copyright holder to say; <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>You have a
license to use this stuff, and to change it, and to distribute it, and
when you distribute it you must extend exactly the same terms to the
others you share it with<span class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>.</p>
<p>Stallman had a mission to make stuff free, in his case software. That's
free as in <em>libre</em>, as in <em>freedom</em>. He was interested in <em>Rights</em> for
software users and creators, and made the GPL as infectious as possible
so that worked to make more software free. But the <strong>legal mechanism</strong>
he invented, the open license, enabled other approaches with other
goals. For example in software, there is the Open Source movement, which
is more pragmatically motivated.</p>
<p>You can read more about these concepts in a free online course:
<a href="http://ftacademy.org/files/materials/fta-m1-intro_to_FS-v1.pdf"><span>Introduction to Free
Software</span></a>
from the <a href="http://ftacademy.org/"><span>Free Technology Academy</span></a>
[1], which is run by a consortium of universities. If you do their free
online course, that counts towards Masters degrees at your pick of the
host institutions.</p>
<p>This Free/Open thing is an important distinction. You could look at OCW
in a Stallman-esque way from the point of view of public good. Generally
speaking this is the MIT approach; <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>benevolent university contributes to the
world<span class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>. Or, you could look at it
from more of a 'business' perspective asking (to put it a bit gauchely);
<span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>what can I get out of this?<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span></p>
<h1><span id="id3"></span><span></span></a>IP?</h1>
<p>I <a href="http://ptsefton.com/2009/05/08/stop-saying-protect-our-ip-in-educational-contexts.htm"><span>wrote last
year</span></a>
about why I think we need to be very clear in Higher Ed when we frame
arguments around open distribution of learning materials, because it's
all too easy to talk about <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>Intellectual Property<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> and <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>protecting our IP<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>, just as Richard Stallman says. I argued
that appeals to protecting IP in universities are actually pretty-much
meaningless unless you (a) focus in on copyright or (b) take <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>Protect our IP<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> as code for <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>Manage our knowledge<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>, which is code for <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>Create a learning and sharing environment
for our community<span class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>. I'm not going to
win this one, I don't think, but I'll keep trying: <strong>Don't say Protect
our IP, think about what you mean, and pick the right legal framework in
which to talk about protection.<span class="footnote"
style="vertical-align: super;"><a href="#ftn2" title="2 Turns out that at the summit, nobody really used the term, although if there had been more Deans or DVCs present I bet we would have heard it a few times. And when I asked a roomful of people if they could tell me what kinds of IP were protected under Australian law nobody spoke up – I must be scary, I'm sure they all know about at least copyright, trademarks and patents. (Answer is here )."><span>2</span></a></span></strong></p>
<p>Which means talking about copyright not Intellectual Property.</p>
<p>At USQ, broadly speaking IP, er sorry, copyright is assigned like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Staff hold the copyright in research publications they write.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The University holds copyright in learning and teaching materials
written by its employees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Copyright in other stuff, books, movies, journals, and so on is a
nightmare <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> Australian Copyright
law offers quite limited <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>Fair
Dealing<span class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> and universities have
to deal with a collection agency,
<a href="http://www.copyright.com.au/"><span>CAL</span></a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To learn more about all this, why not sign up for the September start of
the course on <a href="http://p2pu.org/general/copyright-4-educators-aus"><span>Copyright 4 Educators at
P2PU</span></a> which
uses a free text on copyright [2]?</p>
<p>What this means is:</p>
<p><strong>With research publications,</strong> researchers typically sign away
copyright in articles to publishers in exchange for the services
rendered by the publisher, which include coordinating peer review
<strong>and</strong> frequently selling the work back to the institution that
produced it<span class="footnote"
style="vertical-align: super;"><a href="#ftn3" title="3 Like, if I got you to come around to my market garden and tend my veggies for nothing, then sold them to you. And then I put the prices up. And then I only let you buy cucumbers if you take a box which also includes swedes and brussells sprouts. And then I put the prices up. Twice."><span>3</span></a></span>.
Sometimes, researchers get to keep their copyright post-publication for
one reason or another and then they would be free to license it any way
that they choose <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> that is as long
as they had not entered into a contract with someone else, like say a
publisher, <strong>not</strong> to.</p>
<p><strong>In the Institutional Repository world</strong>, it's pretty standard for some
version of a research article to be put up online, quite often without
an explicit license, so 'officially' that means that fair-use or fair
dealing applies. I thought that this was a bit of a problem as it left
readers with no explicit licence to read <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> so a year ago when I put up a copy of an
article I wrote that had been signed-over to an Elsevier journal I tried
to ask them what license statement to put on my article. They ignored
me. So <a href="http://ptsefton.com/2009/08/19/towards-scholarly-html.htm"><span>I put it up on my blog but warned people not to read
it</span></a>.</p>
<p>Since attending a <a href="http://cairss.caul.edu.au/"><span>CAIRSS</span></a>
copyright workshop, led by our colleagues from Swinburne, though, I
understand why repository managers and publishers live with this
situation <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> nobody wants to have to
deal with thousands of publishers and authors in working out explicit
licenses. It makes sense to just take the permission from the publisher
to put up a copy of the article, find the right version and run with it.
Why am I mentioning this? Just to show that while copyright is key
sometimes it's more practical not to worry about licenses or nothing
would get done, and also to note that some of the decisions around
copyright have a risk-management flavour, and that many of these kinds
of discussions are best had <em>in camera</em>.</p>
<p><strong>With courseware</strong>, at USQ <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> and
I'm talking mainly about the quality-controlled distance-Ed stuff here
<span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> the default is that the university
keeps the copyright and provides access for students; only the students
who have enrolled in that course can see it.</p>
<p>Some materials do find their way onto web servers, pretty-much on the
same kind of basis as repositories work, with no explicit license with
an implicit expectation of fair-use although the copyright is very often
also implicit <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> ie nobody put a
copyright statement on it at all. In reality, who knows what happens to
some materials. I've heard reports from some lecturers that they find
their stuff being used all over the place.</p>
<h1><span id="id4"></span><span></span></a>What counts as OCW?</h1>
<p>So what is OCW, actually? (The statement on the main OCW site is rather
unhelpful) but this appears to be the policy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>OCW course materials are made available to the public under a license
that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Grants users the right to use and distribute the materials either
as-is, or in a modified form:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allows users to create derivative works:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Edit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Translate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reformat</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add to, combine with, or incorporate into other materials</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obliges users to meet certain requirements as a condition of use:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use must be non-commercial (optional)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Materials must be attributed to [Your Institution] and to
original author/contributor</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Publication or distribution of original or derivative
materials must be offered freely to others under identical
terms (&quot;share alike&quot;) (optional).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</blockquote>
<p>The Open Source Initiative have a <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses"><span>list of approved Open Source
licenses</span></a>, and the Free
Software Foundation have a<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses"><span> list of GPL compatible
licenses</span></a>,
I don't think such lists exist for Open CourseWare, would probably be a
good idea.</p>
<h1><span id="id5"></span><span></span></a>The basics, summarised</h1>
<p>I'm not sure if I have much of a conclusion to this little excursion,
except that in discussions of OCW it's worth being aware of the
underpinnings, and the other kinds of open licenses.</p>
<p>And it all comes back to copyright.</p>
<p><strong>Copyright is all-important in open sharing systems.</strong> Whoever owns
that can set license terms for others. Sometimes, it makes sense to
assert your copyright (even though it is automatic in some
jurisdictions) and not to specify a license, but if you want to play
with the OCW or OpenSource crowd then you have to use a license of which
they approve in order to join the group or use their branding.</p>
<p>This use of copyright to share something, seems to me to be pretty
straightforward compared to most other aspects of IP law and even is
certainly simpler than the issues we see in OA repositories, where we
have to let some complex issues slide past, and in teaching and learning
materials where we are unable to let anything slide, and have to go
through very complex auditing processes.</p>
<h1><span id="id6"></span><span></span></a>Some final thoughts</h1>
<p>There is an obvious <strong>advantage to being the one whose materials are out
there being used</strong>. Your copyright statement, and maybe the license can
act as a viral Internet advertisement. I'm not sure what is available in
the way of open licenses that would specify not just that attribution is
required but a particular form that attribution should take, such as
leaving a logo in place. Anyone?</p>
<p>There are some potential deals to be done here <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> if USQ went with an open model then they
could consider assigning copyright back to course writers, for example
if they were able to get it accepted into a peer reviewed journal or
published as a book.</p>
<p>One (unpopular) idea I raised at the summit was that we could release
course materials (just as materials, not with support) complete with a
reading list but with no readings, and any third-party copyright
material greyed-out, with an invitation to sign-up as a student on some
low-cost basis to see the missing bits. This is not an idea I like at
all, but I think it will keep coming up if we pursue OCW on a broad
scale.</p>
<p>A more noble idea and one that got more support at the summit would be
to encourage our course-writers to develop 'clean' courses that don't
have dependencies on things that collection agencies like CAL can take
an interest in, but given our apparent dependency on third-part
copyright materials that will be difficult. And I note, via <a href="http://openeducationnews.org/"><span>Open
Education News</span></a> that when Michael
Geist
<a href="http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/5252/125/"><span>suggested</span></a>
a similar move in Canada recently he was called <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>irresponsible<span

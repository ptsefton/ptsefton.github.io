        Trip Report (with bonus opinions) - Open Repositories 2018, Bozeman Montana, USA
 
        </h1>
        <h2>2018-07-10 </h2>

        <p>I (Peter Sefton) recently attended <a href="http://www.or2018.net/">OR2018</a>, the Open
Repositories conference from June 4-7, 2018 in Bozeman Montana.</p>
<p>This post is being posted on the <a href="https://eresearch.uts.edu.au">UTS eResearch site</a> and on <a href="http://ptsefton.com">my site</a>.</p>
<p>My trip was funded by the University of Technology Sydney (UTS).</p>
<img alt="The sign at the Lewis and Clark Motel" src="lewis_and_clark_sign.JPG">
<h1>Mission</h1>
<p>Gavin Kennedy from QCIF was also in attendance, and we were on something of a
mission - to promote and get feedback on the recent work we've been doing on the
<a href="https://www.redboxresearchdata.com.au/">ReDBox research data management
platform</a>. We ran a ReDBOX intro
workshop on the Monday of the conference. Gavin and I also presented a general
introduction to ReDBOX and the provisioner, and I went into more detail about
<a href="http://ptsefton.com/2018/06/29/DataCrate_2018.htm">the DataCrate standard</a> for
shipping and showing-off research data that I have been leading, with help from
a growing community of supporters. I also did a presentation in the technical
session which included a live demo of using ReDBox to ingest DataCrates -
showing how it could 'sniff out' metadata from DataCrate packages.</p>
<h1>Research Data Management</h1>
<p>Open Repositories now has enough going on about Research Data Management that I
was able to spend most in those sessions when I wasn't meeting with people
directly.</p>
<p>I heard people talk about a few things that helped confirm some of our design
choices at UTS, and a few things to challenge my world view as well.</p>
<p>Vladimir Bubalo from Macquarie, Gavin and I  chased up some more details about the <a href="https://dataverse.org/">Dataverse
repository software</a>.There is some interest from
Macquarie in what's available in the way of open source research data
repositories.</p>
<p>As attested by the session <a href="https://www.conftool.net/or2018/index.php?page=browseSessions&amp;presentations=show&amp;search=australian+data+archive">Reaching out with Data: Dataverse Creating a Global
Community</a>
Dataverse looks like it's a thriving product and would be a good integration
target for ReDBOX, it powers the <a href="https://ada.edu.au/">Australian Data Archive</a>
for one thing and can be used as an institutional data repository. One problem
they're still grappling with is large file support, which is the same issue with
<em>any</em> repository software when you try to put large volumes of, or large numbers
of data streams through the API or web interface.</p>
<p>There was a really interesting talk from the UK Jisc Research Data Shared
Services (RDSS) project (on which I have done some very part time consulting via
Artefactual in Canada) about how they failed to get a Samvera repository working
as part of their offering.</p>
<p>The have published <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CQ_Oc9rRjub-e964_6PKEB1N0H03UEOUb52thDNA3p4/edit#heading=h.y6gyy9rpmdvk">their report</a>.</p>
<p>It seems like the project to adapt Samvera failed not because of large files or
large volumes of files, although that problem may have come up later, as <a href="http://www.doria.fi/handle/10024/97641">we
reported at OR2014</a>, Hydra, which was
rebranded Samvera had severe performance problems on the Alveo virtual lab
related to processing number of files in a single transaction. Two issues Jisc
called out in their report are <em>one</em>, a failure to implement their complex
domain model in Samvera.  They say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In order to capture and store the range of metadata required by the RDSS CDM
the internal storage model of the work type within RDSS Samvera needed to map
closely to the CDM’s conceptual data model. However, it did not prove to be
straightforward to translate the conceptual data model of the RDSS CDM, which
leverages entity-relationships, to a programming/storage model that is largely
intended to be flat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And <em>two</em>, they had problems implementing a message passing model.</p>
<p>In order to avoid the kind of problems reported by Jisc and to deal with the
reality that many researchers just want to gulp-down files, or object-store
blobs, or database tables and most emphatically do not want to sip data
through a tiny API-straw we are building research data management
systems that are distributed:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Avoiding complex customisation of applications wherever possible and instead
linking Research Data Management Plans (RDMPs) to  workspaces in research software
such as lab notebooks or git repositories, and archival data stores using
standard linked data techniques.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Not</em> using message-queues that might block progress on workloads (lesson
learned from ReDBOX 1 development and its ill-conceived &quot;curation&quot;
workflows). We plan to run &quot;bots&quot;, stand alone agents instead which generate
reports or make links or auto-provision spaces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keeping archival data, and data that needs rapid access in large scalable
file storage systems, described and linked to RDMPs, data
descriptions, and data publication records. For us, 'the repository' is a
collection of services which includes the central index and a variety of
stores, rather than a single application: It's a lifestyle; it's not just
for Christmas; and most importantly it's a governance thing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Given the above one of the things I was keen to do at OR2018 was to find out more
about the <em>Oxford Common Filesystem Layout</em> (OCLF) which is being driven by people from
Oxford, Emory, Stanford, Cornell and Duraspace - it's about how you organise
digital assets in the kind of deconstructed architecture I described above for
UTS. The files are kept on a file system (<em>yes</em> cloud-first people, that might
actually be backed by an object-store) so that you can run services against
them: index them for discovery, check their integrity, generate dissemination
versions for distribution, report on items due for disposal and so on.</p>
<p>I couldn't get to the OCFL presentation but lead author Neil Jeffries from Oxford
talked me through the emerging standard and the process being used to develop
it. Neil assured me we can go ahead and implement against the draft spec (and
challenged me with the statement that at Oxford they don't like to talk about
data vs metadata, it's all data. I'm still thinking that over Neil, but I think I
still believe in metadata).</p>
<p>This is from the (still rather sparse) draft dated 2018-06-22, a couple of weeks
after the conference:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A general observation is that the contents of a digital repository -- that is,
the digital files and metadata that an institution might wish to manage -- are
largely stable. Once content has been accessioned, it is unlikely to change
significantly over its lifetime. This is in contrast to the software
applications that manage these contents, which are ephemeral, requiring
constant updating and replacement. Thus, transitions between
application-specific methods of file management to support software upgrades
and replacement cycles can be seen as unnecessary and risky change, changing
the long-term stable objects to support the short-term, ephemeral software.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>By providing a specification for the file-and-folder layout on disk, the OCFL
is an attempt at reducing, or even eliminating, the need for these
transitions. As an application-independent specification, conforming
applications will natively 'understand' the underlying file structure without
needing to first transition these contents to their own format.</p>
<p><a href="https://ocfl.io/">https://ocfl.io/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>From my notes of the conversation with Neil:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Multiple things accessing the file system writing changes to LOGS. Eg fixity
check, or create new.</p>
<p>There is no state. File system is the state.  Digital pres services are
workers / crawler or message queue driven.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The incomplete <a href="https://ocfl.io/is">spec</a> is online - it's not enough to do a
complete implementation yet, but we will track it.</p>
<p>The host university, Montana State had a nice take on this too. Sara Mannheimer,
Jason A. Clark, James Espeland  presented <a href="https://www.conftool.net/or2018/index.php?page=browseSessions&amp;presentations=show&amp;search=A+Prototype+for+the+Institutional+Research+Data+Index">A Prototype for the Institutional
Research Data
Index</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most out-of-the-box institutional repository systems don’t provide the
workflows and metadata features required for research data. Consequently, many
libraries now support two institutional repository systems—one for
publications, and one for research data—even when there are nearly a thousand
data repositories in the United States, many of which provide services and
policies that ensure their trustworthiness and suitability for institutional
research data. Libraries are either increasing spending by purchasing data
repository solutions from vendors, or replicating work by building,
customizing, and managing individual instances of data repository software.
This presentation suggests a potential solution to this issue: a prototype for
an open source Institutional Research Data Index (IRDI) that promotes
discovery and reuse of institutional datasets through automatic metadata
harvesting and search engine optimization. IRDI could lead to a single,
unified index for academic institutional research data. A unified data index
would lead to three key impacts: increasing discovery, reuse, and citation of
open research data; reinforcing the idea that research data is a legitimate
scholarly product; and promoting community-wide systems that require less
resource expenditure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They noted that getting a research data repository up and running is hard and
expensive.</p>
<p>Their solution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deposit data elsewhere in discipline repositories</li>
<li>Have a local IRDI - Institutional Research Data Index</li>
</ul>
<p>This is similar to the ReDBox approach in that it is highly distributed and it
contains an IRDI. The Montana team have soon-to-be-released code that helps find
data that's residing <em>out there</em> on the web, eg in Figshare, which we need to
look in to.</p>
<p>Another thing we should explore ReDBOX is more about how data is stored and
secured. We are working with a product, the DELL/EMC Isilon which has a lot of
features in this area, but I plan to look at the Edinburgh &amp; Manchester
DataVault project as well  <a href="https://www.conftool.net/or2018/index.php?page=browseSessions&amp;form_session=328#paperID165">Sustaining the momentum, moving the DataVault
project to a
service</a>
Claire Knowles presented with with Mary McDerby, Robin Rice, Thomas Higgins</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/DataVault/datavault">DataVault</a> does encrypted multi-site
storage. 3 copies. One on site, one outer Edinburgh on UK cloud. They use
chunking to reduce risk around encryption - lose less of a file if there's a
problem.</p>
<h1>Some highlights</h1>
<p>An insight from Esme Cowles in <a href="https://www.conftool.net/or2018/index.php?page=browseSessions&amp;form_session=231#paperID161">Valkyrie: Reimagining the Samvera Community</a> which is looking at adding swappable back ends to the Samvera platform (so you can use something other than Fedora to store your stuff).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lesson from Islandora - don't fight your host platform.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Speaking of Islandora, in <a href="https://www.conftool.net/or2018/index.php?page=browseSessions&amp;presentations=show&amp;search=Relational+Databases+as+Repository+Objects">Relational Databases as Repository Objects</a> Alexander
Garnett showed off a plugin that gives live access to a SQL database <em>in</em> your
Islandora repository; it spins up a Docker container on demand. I asked Alex on
The Twitter if he'd seen
<a href="https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Datasette</a> but he said that SQLite
does not scale well in his experience.</p>
<p>Thomas Morrell from Caltech mentioned a few interesting things in <a href="https://www.conftool.net/or2018/index.php?page=browseSessions&amp;form_session=236#paperID171">Positioning a repository as campus research infrastructure</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Live visualization from a data reposioty</li>
<li>Demoed fetching data from a <a href="https://tccondata.org/">live repository</a> using a Jupyter notebook.</li>
<li>Harvesting metadata out of git repositories using the <a href="https://codemeta.github.io/user-guide/">codemeta</a> standard.
Codemeta metadata is very close in design to our DataCrate. this could be straight out of DataCrate:</li>

<p>Joshua A. Westgard from the University of Maryland Libraries presented <a href="https://www.conftool.net/or2018/index.php?page=browseSessions&amp;form_session=234#paperID263">a Python
Library for the Fedora
API</a>,
which would have been of interest to us at UTS if we'd gone ahead with our
planned Fedora 4 design for data management instead of joining forces with QCIF
in the new MongoDB based ReDBox.</p>
<p>Chris Diaz from Northwestern University talked about making Static websites over

Repositories</a>,
looks like a great, sustainable alternative to Omeka exhibitions worth
considering in some situations.</p>
<h1>And the winners are...</h1>
<p>I thought I'd pick out a few of the best quotes and one-liners from my notes.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Best quote: Robin Dean</p>
<p><a href="https://www.conftool.net/or2018/index.php?page=browseSessions&amp;form_session=234#paperID222">Fractional agile: how to do iterative development when it’s only part of your job</a></p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Agile development methods such as scrum strongly recommend a dedicated team
for software development, meaning that all team members work solely on one
project at a time. This is not feasible in many of the academic and
open-source community environments where open repositories are developed. This
presentation will encourage developers, managers, and open-source contributors
to find sustainable ways to participate in agile development even if they
can’t dedicate themselves full time to a project. Drawing from my experience
as a scrum master on a digital repository team, I will share practical advice
on setting expectations, communicating about availability, and maintaining a
sustainable pace on a scrum team composed entirely of part-time members.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<h1>THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS AN EXPECTATION THAT IS TOO CLEAR</h1>
</blockquote>
<p>Ta Robin, I've been using this at work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Best catchphrase: Robert S. Doiel, Thomas Morrell</p>
<p><a href="https://www.conftool.net/or2018/index.php?page=browseSessions&amp;form_session=248#paperID173">Building software at the edges of heterogeneous repositories</a>
Caltech Library, United States of America</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Caltech Library has a heterogeneous mix of repository systems (e.g. EPrints
hosts CaltechAUTHORS and CaltechTHESIS, while CaltechDATA is based on
Invenio). Caltech Library has changed its focus from developing in the
specific repository system to one of development at the edges leveraging web
APIs. This has allowed us to not only repurpose content but start working at
collection level curation by integrating external data sources like ORCID,
CrossRef, FundRef and DataCite. The philosophy we have evolved is to work from
copies of the data in JSON form using an Open Source tool Caltech Library
created called <a href="http://caltechlibrary.github.io/dataset">dataset</a> as well as
additional Open Source tools in a project called
<a href="http://caltechlibrary.github.io/datatools">datatools</a>. These command line
tools are written in Go but can be easily used from more popular languages
like Python. This talk will introducing these tools and demonstrate their
usage via Python.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the phrase:</p>
<blockquote>
<h1>CONTINUOUS MIGRATION</h1>
</blockquote>
<p>I liked this phrase because we're migrating data at the moment between RedBox
1 and ReDBox 2 and it's causing my colleague Michael Lynch visible physical
and psychic pain. Robert's articulation of the idea that data migration
should be normal, and done constantly so it's easy and considered business as
usual resonated. But now that I think about it - what we're really aiming for
is to get the core data to stay put and not to move - as per the aims of the
Oxford Common Filesystem Layout I quoted above. The systems that index,
access and analyse the data, and trade metadata are the ones involved in
continuous migration.</p>
<p>I am please to report that Robert has recently been in contact with me to
talk about aligning their dataset project with DataCrate, this is a step
towards DataCrate being able to look inside data files and do stuff like
describe column-headers in tabular data, rather than just describing the
files.</p>

<p>Best &quot;Lesson Learned&quot;: Lars Holm Nielsen, Alexandros Ioannidis, Krzysztof
Nowak, Jose Benito Gonzalez Lopez from CERN</p>
<p><a href="https://www.conftool.net/or2018/index.php?page=browseSessions&amp;form_session=249#paperID304">File loss: hits and near misses</a></p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Repositories increasingly depend on external cloud storage or other complex
distributed systems in order to satisfy ever-growing needs for storing larger
data volumes. The cloud system helps repository manages store terabytes and
petabytes of data, and often simplifies the file management in the underlying
repository software. We trust these systems to store our files, yet, often we
lack understanding of the operation and internals of these systems and how
they can fail. This talk will present two file loss incidents on Zenodo,
uncovering some ways these distributed systems can fail. One incident was
caused by a coincidence of two software bugs in independent systems (the hit),
and a second incident was caused by a human operational mistake in the cloud
storage system (the near miss).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Great talk about when things go wrong. We don't hear enough of these stories.</p>
<p>The lesson?</p>
<blockquote>
<h1>LOG EVERYTHING</h1>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>The venue etc</h1>
<p>Often the OR conference is at a conference centre when in North America but this
one was at the uni, in a lovely part of Bozeman, walkable from Downtown, through
a leafy suburb of early twentieth century houses. The venue was comfy, the food
was fine, and there was a cash bar at the dinner, though with a distinct lack of
options for people who didn't want alcohol, and a decent band, <a href="https://www.littlejaneandthepistolwhips.com/">Little Jane and
the pistol whips</a>. Gotta love that
gun culture. Downtown Bozeman is great, plenty of good food options including
Bison from Ted Turner's ranch. Ted not only revolutionised TV news by inventing
CNN, he is a largest private owner of Bison in the world according to our
server. He's even involved in research...</p>
<p>Q. What did Ted Turner discover when he let 200 Bison loose in the top paddock
for 1 year?</p>

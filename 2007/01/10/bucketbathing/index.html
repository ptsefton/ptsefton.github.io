<h1> 
How to wash yourself with less than 10 litres of water 
</h1>
<h2>2007-01-10 </h2>

<div>
<p>Murray Allen is a the founder of the USQ Community Environment Group.
He's an environmentalist, an engineering student and a friend of the
Sefton/Craig family.</p>
<p>We gave Murray &amp; his bicycle a lift to the wonderful Woodford Festival
over the new year, in our environmentally sound vehicle, and he used the
bike to visit ever y single amenities block to stick up two A4 pages
about how to bathe in less than 10 lites of water.</p>
<p>Yesterday Murray got a call from Channel 9 in Sydney offering to fly him
down so he could go on the Today show, today. Apparently somebody saw
his posters and decided to make a spectacle of him.</p>
<p>Murray contacted me and asked me if I could get the bucket bathing stuff
on the web so he could mention it on the show. Since I happened to have
a spare virtual server lying around I registered
<a href="http://bucketbathing.com/">bucketbathing.com</a> and put Murray's handout
on the site.</p>
<p>I recorded the show, in which Murray washes himself with a bucket and a
sponge on national TV using our DVD recorder (he uses a sponge to wash
himself I used a DVD recored to capture the show) . I had this idea that
it would be simple to get the video and stick it up on youtube or
something. Instead I encountered the wonderful world of .vob files. I
had a MacBook and a dodgy Windows XP computer to hand, so I decided to
have a race between them to see which one could get the video encoded
first.</p>
<p>While I was doing that, I started writing this. Went to the Today show
website and there's the video. You can't see it on a Mac, far as I can
tell, and using Firefox on WinXP it tells you to first install IE 6 –
only when you click on that link Microsoft tries to get you install IE
7. Whatever.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you have the right operating system and browser you have a
10% chance of seeing Murray!</p>
<p>Here's the

link, I think. You'll either see Murray or this (notice the lower case
'f' in <em>free software</em>):</p>

<p>I'll work on getting a more inclusive link to the video.</p>

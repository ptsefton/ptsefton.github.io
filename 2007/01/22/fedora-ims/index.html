<h1> 
Putting web content into a Fedora repository via IMS packages 
</h1>
<h2>2007-01-22 </h2>

<div>
<p>USQ now hosts another DEST-funded project operating in the same space as
RUBRIC: <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/destfred">FRED</a>. That's Federated
REpositories for EDucation. No that would be FREED.</p>
<p>Oliver Lucido, a developer I've worked with before has joined the FRED
team and started immersing himself in the world of repositories and the
e-Framework.</p>
<p>To get him started on the immersion process I asked Oliver to knock out
a bit of code to put IMS content packages into a Fedora repository, via
<a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/">ICE</a>. IMS packages are for exchanging
courseware, but also turn out to be pretty handy for things like large
sets of meeting papers, and packaging
<a href="http://del.icio.us/ptsefton/selfpreservation">theses</a> for web
consumption.</p>
<p>Oliver wrote a bit of proof-of-concept code, which I'm sure will be made
available by the FRED project under an appropriate license.</p>
<p>It works so well that there's actually nothing to see!</p>
<p>Here's the thesis on <a href="http://ptsefton.com/files/packages/honours/default.htm">my web
server</a> so you
can see what it looks like. This is a work in progress <span
class="spCh spCh0x2013">–</span> it is currently missing some emphasis
styles and needs a bit of a general tidy up. There are a couple of
images, copyright someone else, missing too <span
class="spCh spCh0x2013">–</span> not sure what I'm going to do about
that yet. And the USQ logo will have to go! Or will it? If you are
coming in later this may all be fixed up.</p>
<p>Here's a screenshot from the ICE application, showing the crude form for
export to Fedora. The Fedora address is pre-populated by the code, so
all you have to add is a user name and password. Obviously in a real
system that could be hidden too, ICE should be able to identify you to
Fedora, which can work out whether to authorize the deposit.</p>
<p><img src="1.png" alt="graphics2"></p>
<p>And here's a screenshot of the address bar, showing the thesis being
served from Fedora on the mac. See how the URL for a page is
<code>fedora/get/</code> followed by the ID of the object that contains all the
parts, followed by a datastream ID, which is generated from the item's
location in the package run through a hash function to make a usable
Fedora ID.</p>
<p>The approach we took here was to break the code down into two parts.
There is a generic package uploader on the Fedora side and a custom
button, <code>Export to Fedora</code> on the ICE side.</p>
<p><img src="2.png" alt="graphics1"></p>
<p>Using Java to smash up an IMS package (it's just a fancy zip file) and
the SOAP interface to put stuff into Fedora proved easy for Oliver; the
basic code was a matter of a few hours. Getting it to work with the
version of Fedora I have running with VITAL on my virtual test machine,
downgrading it to Java 1.4, and figuring out where to put the .war files
has added a few hours to that. Seemed easy, but deployment got tricky.
We eventually gave up and just went with Fedora 2.1.2. and Java 1.5.
This means that we won't be able to demo the code with VITAL until we
have version 3.</p>
<p>I've <strong>talked to Nigel Ward</strong> of the FRED project about this and it was
a conversation starter alright:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Oliver pointed out that instead of the current approach of changing
the HTML content so that it all points to new Fedora datastreams,
<strong>you could use a disseminator</strong> to munge the content as it is
served <span class="spCh spCh0x2013">–</span> more processing for
each access but it would preserve the relationships better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This will <strong>only work with IMS packages that have their own
navigation</strong>, it doesn't try to do anything with the
table-of-contents-like Organizations that are in the IMS package
manifest (see the XML here). Should we look at writing a
disseminator that understands Organizations?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How about a different model where <strong>every single bit of the package
is an object</strong>, and there is some relationship metadata to tie it
all together? It's easy enough to code, but I think would be
difficult to manage a repository like that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How would you build this</strong> in to a working repository <span
class="spCh spCh0x2013">–</span> would the repository frame the
content in some way or would it simply show the content as-is,
taking over the whole browser?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can we integrate this with <strong>repositories that have their own
workflows</strong>? For example VITAL's web ingest is via a file based bit
of code called VALET that doesn't use Fedora until the item finally
goes into the repository.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h1> 
A first try of Zotero&#39;s Word integration for citations and bibliographies 
</h1>
<h2>2007-03-05 </h2>

<div>
<p><a href="http://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a> is an open source bibliography
management system - think EndNote embedded in your browser - that seems
to be coming along very nicely even if there are
<a href="http://netapps.muohio.edu/blogs/darcusb/darcusb/archives/2007/01/27/zotero-and-the-bazaar-what-zotero-should-learn-from-successful-open-source-projects">concerns</a>that
it is not very open to external contributions. Oh, and the browser has
to be Firefox.</p>
<p>It's important for the
<a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/introduction/ice_rs.htm">ICE-RS</a> project that we
have a good referencing application, and Zotero now looks pretty certain
to be it.</p>
<p>I have been sort-of using Zotero for a while now to collect references,
but its word processor integration only recently appeared and I only got
around to looking at it today.</p>
<p>Here's a few notes on how Zotero works with Microsoft Word 2004 on the
Mac.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I downloaded the disk image, opened the template, and went
<code>File / Save as...</code> - Word helpfully offered to save in a templates
directory so that worked fine <span class="spCh spChx2013">â€“</span>
it's just not what you're meant to do. I should have put it in the
startup folder for Word as described in the instructions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There's a little toolbar with only three buttons. One inserts a
citation, one inserts a bibliography and the other sets a single
preference. That's abut the right number of buttons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Citations get inserted like this: Sefton 2006() - think there must
be a little formatting bug there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My explorations didn't last long because it started complaining that
it could not talk to Firefox, even after I restarted both Word and
Firefox. I think it has problems if you try to include citations
with incomplete data, or delete things from the database and leave
them in the document.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As far as I can tell almost all the work is done by Zotero. The Word
macro uses AppleScript to make web (SOAP) calls to Firefox / Zotero
behind the scenes. This looks very promising for ICE integration; should
be easy to call Zotero with a list of citations and ask it to make a
bibliography.</p>
<p>But, while I'm prepared to accept the limitations of new software, such
as a small number citation styles for the Word plugin, <strong>there's one
thing I really don't like</strong>. Zotero uses Word fields to store citation
information. Those <strong>fields do not work</strong> when you open the document in
OpenOffice.org. That's a complete show-stopper for us. Of course we
could just make a new version of the macro that uses a more
interoperable citation format, but I've attempted to <a href="http://forums.zotero.org/discussion/500/format-for-embedding-citations-in-word-processors/#Item_0">start a discussion
on the Zotero
forums:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My initial experiments indicate that citations embedded in Word using
Fields are lost when the .doc file is opened in OOo. So, can we look
at using a mechanism for carrying citation information that will be
preserved. One approach would be to use bookmarks rather than fields.
I have also considered looking for hyperlinks, matching those against
URLs in Zotero and inserting appropriate citations.</p>
<p>What's the current thinking on this issue within the Zotero team?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Zotero can recognize some kinds of metadata embedded in web pages and
automatically import it. At the moment in doesn't recognize <a href="http://eprints.usq.edu.au/">USQ's
Eprints</a>, even though it has Dublin Core
metadata in the head element. It looks like adding support of our
ePrints would be easy enough. There's an incomplete how-to on the site
explaining how. We'll definitely look into teaching Zotero about ePrints
and the other repositories we deal with in RUBRIC.</p>

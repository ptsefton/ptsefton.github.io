<p><span
style="background-color:transparent; country:US; language:en; "><span
class="T2">I'm looking forward to seeing Peter Murray Rust
</span></span><a href="http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/murrayrust/?p=806"><span
style="background-color:transparent; country:US; language:en; "><span
class="T2">eat my dog
food</span></span></a><span
style="background-color:transparent; country:US; language:en; "><span
class="T2">. He's lucky cos at our place the hounds eat relatively
benign dry food. Oh, and raw chicken wings and mouldy bread and diverse
leftovers deemed to foul for </span></span><a href="http://ptsefton.com/blog/2007/02/08/chooks"><span
style="background-color:transparent; country:US; language:en; "><span
class="T2">the
fowl</span></span></a><span
style="background-color:transparent; country:US; language:en; "><span
class="T2">. Not to mention compost, fertilizer of all kinds of origin,
grass and lizards and parrots when they can get them. Maybe not so
lucky, but I'll buy him a beer to wash it down.</span></span></p>
<p>I'm going to follow up on using ICE for blogging to WordPress soon which
is what that dog food stuff is about, but Peter has just pointed out
some issues with getting papers into institutional repositories and I
wanted to discuss some of his points here.</p>
<p><span
style="background-color:transparent; country:US; language:en; "><span
class="T2">In summary I think that his message is that the
</span></span><a href="http://ptsefton.com/blog/2007/02/07/curation-boundary"><strong><span>curation
boundary</span></strong></a><strong><span>
is too high</span></strong><span
style="background-color:transparent; country:US; language:en; "><span
class="T2"> to cross for authoring teams. Or is it that it is
</span></span><strong><span>too far away</span></strong><span
style="background-color:transparent; country:US; language:en; "><span
class="T2"> from the authoring process?</span></span></p>
<p>Here's his summary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/murrayrust/?p=811"><span
style="background-color:transparent; country:US; language:en; "><span
class="T2">Using our own
repository</span></span></a></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Here are some basic problems about reposting:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the process from starting a manuscript to final publication can
take months or years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>there are likely to be multiple authors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>authors will appear and disappear during the process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>manuscripts may fission or fuse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>authors may come from different institutions</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>PMR then goes on to talk about the solution they're trying. They have
set up an authoring repository when collaborators use Subversion (SVN):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, we are starting to write our papers using our own repository.
Not an IR, but an SVN repository. So Nick, Joe and I will share
versions of our manuscripts in the WWMM SVN repository. Joe wrote his
thesis with SVN/TeX and I think Nick<span
class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>s doing the same. Joe thought it was a
great way to do things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(<a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/">ICE</a> uses Subversion too and it works well for
us, but we have had to put quite a complex layer in front of it so
ordinary non-technical people can deal with it. We have been asked to
support LaTeX; I'll let you all know if that comes off.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The advantage of SVN is that you have a complete version history. The
disadvantage is only that it<span class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>s not
easy to run between institutions. I am not a supporter of
certificates. And remember that not all our authors are part of the
higher education system. In fact Google documents starts to look
attractive (though the versioning is not as nice as SVN.)</p>
<p>Will it work? I don<span class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>t know.
Probably not 100% - we often get bitten by access permissions,
forgetting where things are, etc. But it<span
class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>s worth a try.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two things here:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span
style="background-color:transparent; country:US; language:en; "><span
class="T2">Working between institutions is definitely a problem,
particularly when not everyone is in higher-ed. I'm not sure what
kind of certificates PMR's talking about but I will say this:
</span></span><a href="http://shibboleth.internet2.edu/"><span
style="background-color:transparent; country:US; language:en; "><span
class="T2">Shibboleth</span></span></a><span
style="background-color:transparent; country:US; language:en; "><span
class="T2"> isn't going to solve the problem when there are groups
coming from all over the place any time soon, but
</span></span><a href="http://openid.net/"><span
style="background-color:transparent; country:US; language:en; "><span
class="T2">OpenID</span></span></a><span
style="background-color:transparent; country:US; language:en; "><span
class="T2"> might help. Using OpenID the owner of a working
repository should be able to tell SVN who to trust, using their
OpenID <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> and if you come from an
institution that doesn't use it then you can always get one from
elsewhere.</span></span></p>
<p><span
style="background-color:transparent; country:US; language:en; "><span
class="T2">Should work for web application, but it could be a
challenge to get the commandline version of SVN working with OpenID
because some OpenID providers might require you to use a web-GUI to
authenticate, but </span></span><a href="http://bloritsch.d-haven.net/articles/2007/07/27/openid-as-authentication-wrapper"><span
style="background-color:transparent; country:US; language:en; "><span
class="T2">people</span></span></a>
have <a href="http://brad.livejournal.com/2206769.html"><span
style="background-color:transparent; country:US; language:en; "><span
class="T2">thought about
it</span></span></a><span
style="background-color:transparent; country:US; language:en; "><span
class="T2">.</span></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span
style="background-color:transparent; country:US; language:en; "><span
class="T2">Google docs? Well as discussed here before Stijn Dekeyser
and Richard Watson of USQ found that</span></span><a href="http://ptsefton.com/blog/2006/12/06/goog_docs"><span
style="background-color:transparent; country:US; language:en; "><span
class="T2"> it makes a good online text editor with supernatural
collaborative
powers</span></span></a><span
style="background-color:transparent; country:US; language:en; "><span
class="T2">. If you want to edit in raw LaTeX that is. They made a
demo system that lets you render Google docs, even. But as a word
processor? </span></span><a href="http://ptsefton.com/blog/2007/07/05/the_web_with_google_docs"><span
style="background-color:transparent; country:US; language:en; "><span
class="T2">No</span></span></a><span
style="background-color:transparent; country:US; language:en; "><span
class="T2">. You'd be stopped by the lack of support for stuff like
bibliographies and Maths before you got too far and don't get me
restarted on the HTML it makes.</span></span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I liked the last bit, so I added some emphasis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And <strong>if I were funding repositories I would certainly put resource
into communal authoring environments</strong>. If you do that, then it really
is a one-click reposition instead of the half-day mess of trying to
find the lost documents.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'll be sure to mention this to our friends at DEST.</p>

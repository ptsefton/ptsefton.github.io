<p>I keep forgetting to turn on the comments on this site and when I do I
forget to check them. You can always send me an email, like Jean-Claude
Bradley, who responds to <a href="http://ptsefton.com/blog/2007/09/21/09-33-08.277706">my post on Shared Notebook
Science</a>. I'm
reproducing his email here in full. More from me below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Peter,</p>
<p>Thanks for discussing Open Notebook Science and linking to my
presentations!</p>
<p>I didn't see a way to leave a comment so I'm sending you a quick email
response.</p>
<p>The curation boundary problem is a tricky one when we move away from
the standard article format. Interpretation of the data is in flux
after it has been recorded in the lab notebook, either because new
information comes to light or errors are corrected. We like to think
that traditional peer reviewed articles are set in stone and &quot;fully
ready for curation&quot; but the reality is that the scientific literature
is full of errors (especially errors of omission) and it is really
really hard to get an author to admit they made a mistake and publish
an erratum or retract a paper once in print. I think that this is the
source of a lot of reluctance to provide raw data. If we operate under
ONS &quot;no insider information&quot; at all times, it is much harder to fall
into that trap. That is one reason I am a proponent of ONS but I don't
think it is necessary for everyone to do things that way (especially
if IP issues are involved). I like your term &quot;Shared Notebook Science&quot;
to describe an intermediate scenario.</p>

<p>Jean-Claude makes some good points here about the value of openness for
science, particularly <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span> it is really
really hard to get an author to admit they made a mistake and publish an
erratum or retract a paper once in print<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>.</p>
<p>In my previous post I cut some stuff about how I now favour working in
the open as much as possible, so I'll talk a bit about that now.</p>
<p>I mentioned the RUBRIC project, and the fact that we had a <strong>shared but
not open</strong> workspace. This presents us with a problem at the close of
the project. Participants in the project want a take-away version of the
shared space. But the shared space belongs to the trusted community, not
to their organizations or to the whole world. We're going to have to do
grab a snapshot of the Trac wiki, but we can't put it in a repository so
we will have to give everyone their own souvenir DVD.</p>
<p>(Some of the partner project managers on RUBRIC note that they liked the
shared space because it gave them a chance to ask dumb questions, and
put up drafts that they would not be happy to circulate more widely.
Maybe in future I just need to work with people who don't ask dumb
questions :-)</p>
<p>But seriously, this is an issue that needs to be addressed. There do
need to be places where people can draft things in-group, before moving
them out to the public. Even in open notebook science I'm sure most
people would not like to draft blog posts or wiki pages in public. The
challenge is to provide a shared workspace that's private but to move as
much as possible into the open as soon as possible, so at the end of a
project you don't have stuff hanging around that can't be archived
because it belongs to an ad-hoc project group which no longer exists.</p>
<p>I'm keen in future projects to try making all our 'notebooks' open as
far as possible, in the way we do in the ICE project, where our <a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/trac/roadmap">Trac
site</a> is open to read, or on the
AANRO evaluation project where there's a <a href="http://aanro-repo.blogspot.com/">project
blog</a> and the final report will be
available under a Creative Commons license, but that doesn't mean that
you're going to be seeing my draft blog posts.</p>

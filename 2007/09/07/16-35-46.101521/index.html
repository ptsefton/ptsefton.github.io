<p>Jon Udell <a href="http://blog.jonudell.net/2007/09/05/xml-documents-flavors-versus-essence/">returns to XML word processing document
formats</a>,
while ignoring the current standards debate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have steered clear of the politics surrounding XML document formats
both before and after joining Microsoft. But I was, and will always
be, an outspoken advocate for the idea of XML documents. That<span
class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>s a message that doesn<span
class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>t make headlines but bears repeating.
We have hardly begun to appreciate or exploit the value of XML. A
couple of articles in the current issue of
<a href="http://www.ctwatch.org/quarterly/about.html">CTQuarterly</a>, a journal
about how cyberinfrastructure enables science, illuminate that point.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.ctwatch.org/quarterly/articles/2007/08/next-generation-implications-of-open-access">Next-Generation Implications of Open
Access</a>,
Paul Ginsparg writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the surprises of the past two decades is how little progress
has been made in the underlying document format employed.
Equation-intensive physicists, mathematicians, and computer
scientists now generally create PDF from TeX. It is a methodology
based on a pre-1980s print-on-paper mentality and not optimized for
network distribution. The implications of widespread usage of newer
document formats such as Microsoft<span
class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>s Open Office XML or the OASIS
OpenDocument format and the attendant ability to extract semantic
information and modularize documents are scarcely appreciated by the
research communities.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>I'd like to pick up on one of the key things you'd want to do with any
document. <strong>You'd want to put it on the web</strong>. Never mind integrating
semantic data, such as <a href="http://ptsefton.com/blog/2007/06/22/cml_demo">I demoed with CML for chemsitry
data</a>, the first thing is
to be able to publish it properly. Then we'll talk about easy-to-use
integration with e-Research tools. Really, we will. But can we learn to
make web documents? The web is in its late teens and word processors
don't get it yet.</p>
<p>(And when we do talk about integrating data into documents I don't think
the Microsoft Approach of dumping arbitrary XML in the midst of
documents is going to be the answer for most of us. That way lies
expensive development and lots of ongoing maintenance. I think we'll get
a lot more traction with a microformat type approach, where we co-opt
features that are already there and tie them to other services.)</p>
<p>It's not sufficient to use OOXML or ODF, to make research accessible
<strong>you need to be able to</strong> <a href="http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00002653/"><strong>make web pages, not just
PDF</strong>.</a></p>
<p>The word processors that use OOXML and ODF <a href="http://del.icio.us/ptsefton/xhtmlchallenge">don't make HTML very well at
all</a>.</p>
<p>Regular readers know what comes next. If you want to (a) use a word
processor and (b) make your research available in more than just PDF
then you need to find tools that support you. One such tool (and there
are not many, I assure you) is <a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/">ICE</a>, which Jon
has linked to before with kind comments.</p>
<p>ICE gives you a default-but-extensible stylesheet, and you can use it to
write <a href="http://ptsefton.com/blog/2007/05/15/etd_paper">articles</a>,
<a href="http://ptsefton.com/blog/2007/08/24/18-43-00.855588">theses</a>, books and
so on, with both PDF and HTML output <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> this is the point of the
<a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/introduction/ice_rs.htm">ICE-RS</a> project.</p>
<p>Early next week we release a update of ICE which talks ATOM publishing
protocol, which means that you can post to the growing number of
ATOM-ready web services. When more of them support media libraries we'll
add support for images and PDF as well.</p>
<p>Daniel de Byl has lef the silent era of screencasting and is now
speaking when he does his demos. See him in action <a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/media/videos/app_from_ice_01.swf">demonstrating
atompub from
ICE</a>.</p>
<p>But as <a href="http://www.tomw.net.au/blog/2007/04/creating-coordinated-web-pdf-and.html">Tom Worthington notes ICE is still a bit hard to get going
with</a>,
so beyond next week we're about to release a few things that should
really help:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A server-based version of ICE. Nothing for authors to install but
the Word template or OpenOffice.org toolbar and they're away.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A server-free version so that you can convert documents from your
word processor and do what you like with them (including using ATOM
to push them to a server).</p>
<p>Initially you'll need to download and install OpenOffice.org and ICE
which together perform the conversion. But once installed you can
then ignore them and use Word to write if you wish.</p>
<p>Later we'll probably hook it up to a web service too so you don't
need to run much locally at all, which brings us to;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A RESTful web service so you can get all Web 2-dot-0 with your other
web apps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A commandline tool (and/or Python library) that you can use as part
of another application.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Oh, and remember, people, to <a href="http://del.icio.us/ptsefton/usestyles">use
styles</a>.</p>

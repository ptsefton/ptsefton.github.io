Identifiers should not contain semantics - except when they should

<h2>2007-07-13 </h2>

<p><a href="/blog/2007/07/13/12:03:16.154030/100.pdf">View this page as PDF</a></p>
<div>
<p>I've been working with software designed for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_Repository">institutional
repsoitories</a>
(IRs) now for quite a while. At RUBRIC we <a href="http://rubric.edu.au/repositories/choosing_a_repository.htm">helped our network of
partners to evaluate repository
software</a>.
Follow that link to read about DSpace, Eprints, Fez and VITAL.</p>
<p>Having worked with four and a bit applications (the 'bit' is the Mura
application which is not complete), and with the RUBRIC project coming
to an end in December 2007, I've started to think about things that
could be improved in future generations of repositories.</p>
<p>One area where I don't think any of the applications are doing the best
they could is in helping repository managers in enforcing best practice
for keeping stable URLs for objects, and giving things <strong>useful
identifiers for use in different contexts</strong> (No, It's not enough just to
have handles).</p>
<p>A lot of people say that best practice for identifiers is that they
should be semantically null. That is, there's no meaning in them that
humans think they can decode. This really makes sense for published
resources. If you base an identifier on anything that might change or
you might get wrong then you have a problem; once an identifier has been
published then someone may have used it and it is not good to invalidate
the old identifier. You either have to have infrastructure to maintain
old identifiers or be very strict about not renaming things. For
example, if part of the name is the name of your company or university
what happens if it gets gobbled up by a bigger company or university or
your department moves between institutions?</p>
<p>(See <a href="http://weibel-lines.typepad.com/weibelines/2006/02/identifier_ideo.html">this easy to read discussion of the
issue</a>.)</p>
<p>On the other hand, having identifier with some semantics can be really
helpful in some cases, and it's essential for things that people need to
manage by hand, such as word processing files.</p>
<p>One example where identifiers with semantics are nice is blogging, where
it feels right, and is really useful to have the classic blog
/year/month/day/ as part of the path. But there are issues with the last
part. I sometimes create identifiers for blog posts that are a bit funny
looking by mistyping.</p>
<p>So if I had been blogging when I was thirteen, I might have made an
identifier like: <em>http://ptsefton.com/blog/1978/05/16/mispellled_id</em></p>
<p>Note the identifier is not just he misspelled bit at the end, <strong>it's the
entire URI</strong>. <a href="http://norman.walsh.name/2006/07/25/namesAndAddresses">Norm Walsh spells this
out.</a> As he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As names, <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>HB88<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>, <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>http://norman.walsh.name/knows/what#nikon-5700<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>, and <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>newscheme:x:y:n5700<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> are entirely equivalent. They're just
strings.</p>
<p><a href="http://norman.walsh.name/2006/07/25/namesAndAddresses">http://norman.walsh.name/2006/07/25/namesAndAddresses</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For me this is an OK identifier <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> I
figure I can keep the domain registered and make sure that as I migrate
the blog across software platforms I can keep supporting those
identifiers. There's little chance of error as the year / month / day
part of the identifier is generated for me by a machine. And I really
don't see what harm the date in the path is doing. (And if I decide to
move things around I can always use handles to help me)</p>
<p><strong>My policy</strong> at my web site is that once I have published an item I
won't go back and change the identifier, because it's out there and one
of my four regular readers may have bookmarked it or tagged it, or
posted about it. (I will fix typos within a post if I see them, but
apart from that all updates will be noted at the top of the post).</p>
<p>But <strong>I often make mistakes</strong> in generating identifiers. So I'm going to
remove the error-prone bit and change the way I make ID's starting with
this post.</p>
<p>The last part of the Identifier on posts is usually generated from the
file name I use to write the document.. The filename on this one is
<code>repository-interfaces.odt</code> which is not at all what it ended up being
about. See, that's an example of a <em><strong>meaningful identifier gone
wrong</strong></em>.</p>
<p>So I'm going to replace this code which generates the last part of the
ID from the filename:</p>
<p>thisPostName = os.path.splitext( os.path.split(self.path)[1])[0]</p>
<p>With this, which uses the time:</p>
<p>thisPostName = str(datetime.datetime.now().time())</p>
<p>The time will reflect the point at which I decide the post is nearly
ready not the time it goes onto my server. For my purposes this is
<strong>unique and it's machine generated</strong> so there will be no spelling
errors (there's only one of me to hit the button so I can't do two posts
at the same millisecond).</p>
<p>At the moment I make a new document in ICE by clicking <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>Create new Writer document<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> , and choosing a file name.</p>
<p>As I refine the process I use for blogging, it may be that I can let go
of the idea of having an identifier I need to manage at all. I could let
ICE create a new document with a GUID (Globally Unique ID) and tell it
the title. That way, if the document evolves and the title changes then
I will see the new title via ICE, and I will see the item in any of the
categories I've added it to using our forthcoming tagging feature <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> I never need to see the filename, and it
may as well be an opaque number.</p>
<p>Some other examples:</p>
<p>For photos
:   I'm happy to have opaque names for individual files because Picassa
does a good hob of showing me my photos.</p>
<p>For music files
:   I use ITunes and virtually never look at the files <span
    class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> happy to have it handle the naming
when it imports a CD, and it's almost irrelevant to me that songs
happen to have semantically useful filenames because the metadata
does all the work and I never see the files.</p>
<p>For item in an institutional repository
:   These can (and usually are) be represented by a semantically opaque
identifier such as this one. You'll have to go and look at it to see
what it is :-)
:   <a href="http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00002653/">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00002653/</a>
:   But the actual paper for item 2653 uses an identifier with a bit
more semantics:
:   <a href="http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00002653/01/Sefton_etd_2007.pdf">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00002653/01/Sefton_etd_2007.pdf</a>
:   This is not ideal, as naming the paper is done by humans. I have
worked through some the issues to do with the naming of papers in
USQ's repositories with the humans who run it. The software doesn't
help them as much as it should. I think the datastreams (eg a PDF)
should have opaque identifiers at the server side, but if a user
downloads one the repository software should assign it a file name
that helps the reader to manage it. So the filename for a paper like
this could be: usq_2653_sefton_2006-1. Or something. At least
this gives someone a clue what's in the paper.</p>
<p>For PDFs downloaded from online sources
:   I used to leave them lying around my Desktop, so if repositories
assigned useful names to downloaded files (not their online
identifiers) that would really help.
:   But I bet I'll soon be using a tool like
<a href="http://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a> to pull documents out of web sites
and manage them for me, so I need never see a file name.</p>
<p>So here's a draft principle.</p>
<p>Identifiers should have semantics only under some circumstances:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>For items managed by computers identifiers should be semantically
null except where semantics are absolutely inarguable and guaranteed
to be correct. (Eg a time-stamp for a blog entry)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For items managed by users, or which might need to be managed by
users later, on their own computers identifiers should have useful
semantics, but we should work hard on building tool-chains that mean
that user's <em>don't have to manage identifiers at all,</em> anyway.</p>
</li>
</ol>

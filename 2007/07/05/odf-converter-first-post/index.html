        Sun ODF converter for MS Word - version 1 review

<div>
<p><a href="http://blogs.sun.com/webmink/entry/odf_plug_in_for_ms"><span class="Internet_20_link">Via Simon
Phipps</span></a>
comes the news that Sun has released its OpenDocument Format plugin for
Word. I <a href="http://ptsefton.com/blog/2007/02/21/Sun_odf_plugin"><span class="Internet_20_link">tested this a while
ago</span></a> and
found it wanting. It was too slow and it mangled documents. This time it
seems to be a bit better.</p>
<p>I<span class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>m starting this post in Word 2003,
and I<span class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>m going to bounce it backwards
and forwards with NeoOffice on the Mac a few times to see if I can
actually use this converter, as opposed to the depressing experiences
with ODF to Word conversion I reported in February.</p>
<p>I<span class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>m having similar issues to last
time. Most things seem to round-trip with some glitches with lists, but
in Word we have a <span class="spCh spChx2018">‘</span>repair lists<span
class="spCh spChx2019">’</span> macro that uses the style names. But
this time it is faster. Still slow but faster. And it has not so far
completely mangled my document and lost the headers and footers.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sun.com/software/star/staroffice/index.jsp">The Sun site
says</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Plug in is easy to setup and use, the conversion happens
transparently and the additional memory footprint is minimal.
Microsoft Office users now can have seamless two-way conversion of
Microsoft Office documents to and from Open Document. The ODF Plug in
runs on Microsoft Windows and is available in English. More language
support will be available in later releases.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sun.com/software/star/staroffice/index.jsp">http://www.sun.com/software/star/staroffice/index.jsp</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would not call it transparent or seamless, as the screen flashes and
you can see that the plugin is saving stuff into a temp file, and it's a
significant delay over the native save process. Sometimes your document
disappears and then comes back, too.</p>
<h1><span id="id1"></span>The verdict</h1>
<p>You can read on below for more detail but the verdict is that this is
now ready for us to test in more detail <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> to see if we can use it in real life in
ICE.</p>
<p>It is still very slow though. I tried in on a real paper of about 5000
words with a dozen or so graphics and you're looking at 30 or 40 seconds
to open it on my modest computer at home.</p>
<p><a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/">ICE</a> supports the .doc format but it causes
problems, as we can't really get the ICE server to fix people's
documents when they are in .doc format. While this plugin is actually
using the same code to convert from word to ODF as the OpenOffice.org
does, it is still a step forward.</p>
<p>Simon mentions the <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/star/staroffice/support.jsp">support
services</a>, no
sign of how you feed back bugs, though.</p>
<p>So we're going to look into this. I will get some tests done to see how
it interacts with EndNote and Zotero bibliographies.</p>
<h1><span id="id2"></span>More detail</h1>
<p>ICE lists in Writer work by defining both a paragaraph style and a list
style for each different list / level combination to work around the
complex and unusable list model in Writer and allow interop with Word.
In the round tripping the paragraph style names are preserved, but list
style names get replaced with names like WW8Num25, which means that
existing lists work, but if you want to add to a list you have to put
the correct list styles back on them. We can automate this in ICE, so
it's no big deal for our users.</p>
<p>But there's one gotcha that I ran across. I reapplied the list syle
<code>li2n</code> to the items in the list below but the numbering was still wrong
when I added a new item.</p>
<p><img src="1.png" alt="graphics1"></p>
<p>See how the last item is numbered 2? It took a while, but finally I
realised that the first three items where in list style <code>li2n</code> but
<code>level 2</code>. You have to look at this tiny status-bar thing down the
bottom:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2007/07/05/odf-converter-first-post/2.jpg" alt="graphics2"></p>
<p>What's happening is that the converter is not only assigning things to
new list styles it's messing around with the level. I can't see any good
reason for this, but then I can't see the reason for the design of the
whole list system. I think it's just an unfortunate legacy of the old
StarOffice from years ago.</p>
<p>So I was able to fix the lists by promoting all the items to level 1.
Again, we can deal with this automatically. This may be the solution is
was looking for a couple of days ago when I <a href="http://ptsefton.com/blog/2007/07/03/the_web_with_writer"><span
class="Internet_20_link">had trouble with list
formatting</span></a>
in Writer.</p>
<p>Another problem is that unused styles go missing, so in Word you have to
keep re-attaching the ICE template to the document (which I<span
class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>m sure we could automate) and in ICE you
may have to reload styles into the document if you want to use one that
is not already in the document, but again we can probably work around
this, it may be a matter of improving our extension technology, or
making ICE able to create styles it doesn't have automatically.</p>
<p>The messy picture below seems to be round-tripping about 85%. The main
issue is that when I inserted it from Insert / Picture / New Drawing ICE
can<span class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>t render it properly so I
converted it into a Windows Meta File, which messed it up. That<span
class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>s one for the ICE team to fix if
possible.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2007/07/05/odf-converter-first-post/3.gif" alt="graphics3"></p>
<h1><span id="id3"></span>Tests</h1>
<p>Definition lists
:   These don<span class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>t use any list
functions, and they work fine.</p>
<p>Bullet lists
:   This is a definition list with:
-   A bullet list in it</p>
<p>-   With two bullets</p>
<p>How about a Blockquote in here:</p>
<p>&gt; <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>This is quoted text.<span
        > class=&quot;spCh spChx201d&quot;&gt;”</span></p>
<p>-   And a third bullet</p>
<p>Numbered lists</p>
<p>:   1.  This is a numbered list</p>
<p>SOME PREFORMATTED TEXT EMBEDDED IN THE LIST.</p>
<p>USE THIS FOR PROGRAM CODE</p>
<p>2.  With two numbers</p>
<p>1.  And an embedded Roman-numbered list</p>
<p>2.  With two items in it</p>
<p>3.  Make that 3 numbers</p>
<p>1.  We need to check that this list restarts correctly when</p>
<p>2.  It is round tripped</p>
<p>4.  Adding a fourth list item in NeoOffice <span
        class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> having trouble with the
numbering on this one.</p>

<h1> 
Trip Report -     Open Repositories 2019 - Peter Sefton 
</h1>
<h2>2019-07-01 </h2>

<p>This is <a href="https://eresearch.uts.edu.au/2019/07/01/OR2019.htm">reposted from the UTS eResearch Website</a> with minor edits.</p>
<p>This year Open Repositories was in Hamburg, Germany. I was funded by my employer the
University of Technology Sydney to attend. I gave two presentations, one on <a href="/2019/07/01/OCLF.htm">our work on scalable research data repositories</a>
and other on <a href="/2019/07/01/DataCrate-OR2019.htm">research data packaging</a> and ran a workshop, more on
which is below.</p>
<p>This year was an intense, focussed conference for me. <a href="http://ptsefton.com/2018/07/10/or2018.htm">Last year</a>
I had a few take-aways from presentations; this year was one of those
conferences where the value was in the conversations and in getting down to
work.</p>
<h1>Keynotes</h1>
<p>I didn't get much out of the opening Keynote, from <a href="https://jeffgothelf.com/">Jeff Gothelf</a>, who's
apparently a star in the User Experience (UX) world. It was a pretty generic
presentation, with some well timed jokes but not very <em>useful</em>. Ok, UX is
important, but when your examples are coming from well-resourced projects what
are resource-constrained repository workers supposed to do to improve UX?</p>
<p>My mate <a href="https://cottagelabs.com/">Richard Jones</a> from Cottage Labs asked a great question about how we can improve
the UX for developers using APIs but didn't get much of an answer.</p>
<p>Even though I would have preferred a more on-topic keynote, it did spark a
number of useful conversations in the breaks, including some I had with Richard
about how we can build developer-friendly services. I always learn lots from Mr
Jones at OR.</p>
<p>The closing Keynote was much more audience-appropriate. <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1613-5981">Heather Piwowar</a>, who
has, like, direct User Experience of Open Repositories gave us all a kind of
career-affirming hug; pointing out that the repository people in the room are
helping to build huge database of open scholarly information.</p>
<p>We put up and maintain the content, and her <a href="https://unpaywall.org/">Unpaywall</a> site finds it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An open database of 23,565,946 free scholarly articles.
We harvest Open Access content from over 50,000 publishers and repositories, and make it easy to find, track, and use.
<a href="https://unpaywall.org/">https://unpaywall.org/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>She reckons our
time is about to come - that we're at the take-off point for hockey-stick
growth. Here's her presentation
<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/hpiwowar/open-repositories-2019-closing-keynote-heather-piwowar">The Breakout Moment for open repositories is now</a>.
On topic, useful and inspiring.</p>
<h1>Workshop in data packaging</h1>
<p><a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8131-2150">Eoghan Ó Carragáin</a>, <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9842-9718">Stian Soiland-Reyes</a> and I ran an all-day workshop on Data Packaging
which was well attended - we ran through the background in the morning, what
data packaging is all about, why it's important and Eoghan gave us a tour of
some of the major efforts going on in the space at the moment. Stian gave more
detail on Research Objects, and <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9530-627X">Marina  Soares E Silva</a> talked about recent developments with Mendeley Data.</p>
<p>We structured the discussion around these themes or functions of Research Data Packaging:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Strategic: Transform scholarly practice, distribute the stuff that makes
research complete, focus on redo-ability and reproducibility (eg Research
Object) - Self-documenting: Describe the stuff in a programmer friendly way
(eg FD, DataCrate), with a view to making it interoperable (eg DataCrate, RO),
try to ensure Reusability (RO) - add human readable HTML (DataCrate,
DataSpice)</li>
<li>Self-contained: Bundle stuff (eg Zip, TAR, .dmg, RAR).</li>
<li>Safe: Make sure the stuff is what it’s supposed to be using checksums (eg BagIt, FD) &amp; Preservation / archival practice</li>
<li>Serialization Syntax: XML (Legacy systems), JSON (FD) Linked Data (RDF, JSON-LD eg RO, DataCrate)</li>
<li>Schemas - which one(s) to use?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>We did a quick pass on these topics in the morning, looped back to the most
popular ones in the afternoon - has some impromptu lightning talks and finished
up with a session where we solicited Use Cases to go into the <a href="/2019/07/01/DataCrate-OR2019.htm">RO-Crate</a> process
Thanks go to <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1541-5631">Paul Walk</a> and <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3311-3741">Neil Jefferies</a> both of whom I've known for a
decade or so for showing up and contributing enthusiastically.</p>
<h1>My conference</h1>
<img alt='Hotel converted from an old water tower' src='movenpick.jpg'>
<p>I was lucky in my choice of converted water tower to stay in. I got to have
breakfast with <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1419-2405">Martin Fenner</a> from DataCite (we met back in 2011
at the first Beyond the PDF meeting). He was on the list for our Monday workshop
but couldn't make it. I filled Martin in on what we're doing with <a href="/2019/07/01/DataCrate-OR2019.htm">RO-Crate</a> - how we're using Schema.org metadata in JSON-LD. Martin was completely on-board
with using Schema.org, and told me that if we have that, then using the DataCite
XML format would probably be redundant. If that works out then that simplifies
things - we need to talk more about this on the RO-Crate Project.</p>
<p>Martin also seemed to me to be frustrated that there are still a number of
packaging efforts with no clear leader - simple, I said, just endorse RO-Crate
when it comes out as DataCite approved :)</p>
<p>Stian and Eoghan and I took the opportunity to get stuck in to editing the
RO-Crate draft, and getting to know each other a bit - forging a strong editorial team for <a href="/2019/07/01/DataCrate-OR2019.htm">RO-Crate</a>.</p>
<p>I chaired a short-presentation session (7 minutes, 24 slides) - I like to get
the presenters all down on stage at the end, get them to re-introduce
themselves, give them a minute to tell us anything they forgot in the heat of
presentation then get a discussion going.</p>

<h1>Hamburg</h1>
<img alt='A pretty shop' src='alsterhaus.jpg'>
<img alt='Stickers on rubbish bins' src='stickers.jpg'>
<p>Hamburg's a great place to wander around - lots of parks and lots of stickers on
garbage bins  that I really liked.</p>

<p>Hamburg harbour, where we went for the conference dinner boat ride, is a giant
metaphor for Data Packaging. Container terminals as far as the eye can see being
loaded and unloaded by giant robot-cranes. Shipping containers are, of course, a
triumph of standardization and here you could see them being moved around at
industrial scale - just like we're going to do using RO-Crate for Research Data.</p>

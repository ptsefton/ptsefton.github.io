<p>From June 9th-13 ^th^ I attended the Open Repositories conference way up
North in Helsinki. This year I was not only on the main committee for
the conference, but was part of a new extension to the Program
Committee, overseeing the Developer Challenge event, which has been part
of the conference since <a href="http://or08.ecs.soton.ac.uk/">OR2008 in
Southampton</a> . I think the dev challenge
went reasonably well, but probably requires a re-think for future
conferences, more on that below.</p>
<p>In this too-long-you-probably-won’t read post I’ll run through a few
highlights around the conference theme, the keynote and the dev event.</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> For me the take-away was that now we have a repository
ecosystem developing, and the OR catchment extends further and further
beyond the library, <strong>sustainability is the big issue</strong> , and
conversations around sustainability of research data repositories in
particular are going to be key to the next few iterations of this
conference. Sustainability might make a good theme or sub-theme. Related
to sustainability is risk; how do we reduce the risk of the data
equivalent of the <a href="http://sites.tufts.edu/scholarlycommunication/open-access/the-serials-crisis-explained/">serials
crisis</a>
if there is such a crisis it won’t look the same, so how we will stop
it?</p>

<h2>Keynote</h2>
<p>The keynote this time was excellent. Neuroscientist <a href="http://emckiernan.wordpress.com/">Erin
McKiernan</a> from Mexico gave an
impassioned and informed view of the importance of Open Access: <a href="http://figshare.com/articles/Culture_change_in_academia_Making_sharing_the_new_norm_/1053008">Culture
change in academia: Making sharing the new
norm</a>
(McKiernan, 2014). Working in Latin America McKiernan could talk
first-hand about how the scholarly communications system we have now
disadvantages all but the wealthiest countries.</p>
<p>There was a brief flurry of controversy on Twitter over a question I
asked about the risks associated with commercially owned parts of the
scholarly infrastructure and how we can manage those risks. I did state
that I thought that Figshare was owned by McMillan’s Digital Science,
but was corrected by Mark Hahnel; Digital Science is an investor, so I
guess “it is one of the owners” rather than “owns”. Anyway, my question
was misheard as something along the lines of “How can you love Figshare
so much when you hate Nature and they’re owned by the same company”.
That’s not what I meant to say, but before I try to make my point again
in a more considered way, some context.</p>
<p>McKiernan had shown a slide like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My pledge to be open</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I will not edit, review, or work for closed access journals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I will blog my work and post preprints, when possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I will publish only in open access journals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I will not publish in Cell, Nature, or Science.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I will pull my name off a paper if coauthors refuse to be open.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If I am going to ‘make it’ in science, it has to be on terms I can
live with.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="_GoBack"> </a> Good stuff! If everyone did this, the Scholarly
Communications process would be forced to rationalize itself much more
quickly than is currently happening and we could skip the endless
debates about the “Green Road” and the “Gold Road” and the “Fools Gold
Road”. It’s tragic we’re still debating using this weird
colour-coded-speak <a href="http://poynder.blogspot.com.au/2014/06/the-subversive-proposal-at-20.html">twenty years in to the
O</a>
<a href="http://poynder.blogspot.com.au/2014/06/the-subversive-proposal-at-20.html">A
movement</a>
.</p>
<p>Anyway, note the mention of <em>Nature</em> .</p>
<p>What I was <em>trying</em> to ask was: How can we make sure that McKiernan
doesn’t find herself, in twenty years time, with a slide that says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I will not put my data in Figshare”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is, how do we make sure we don’t make the same mistake we made with
scholarly publishing? You know, where academics write and review
articles, often give up copyright in the publishing process, and
collectively we end up paying way over the odds for a toxic mixture of
rental subscriptions and author-pays open-access, with some risk the
publisher will ‘forget’ to make stuff open.</p>
<p>I don’t have any particular problem with Figshare as it is now, in fact
I’m promoting its use at my University, and working with the team here
on being able to post data to it from our <a href="http://uws.edu.au/eresearch/home/projects/cr8it">Cr8it data publishing
app</a> . All I’m saying
is that we must remain vigilant. The publishing industry has managed to
transform itself under our noses from: <em>much needed distribution service
of tangible goods</em> ; to <em>rental service where we get access to The
Literature pretty-much only if we keep paying</em> ; to its new position as
<em>The custodian of The Literature for All Time</em> , usurping libraries as
the place we keep our stuff.</p>
<p>We need to make sure that the appealing free puppy offered by the
friendly people at Figshare doesn’t grow into a vicious dog that mauls
our children or eats up the research budget.</p>
<p>So, remember, Figshare is not just for Christmas.</p>
<p>Disclosure: After the keynote, I was invited to an excellent Thai dinner
by the Figshare team, along with Erin and a couple of other
conference-goers. Thanks for the salmon and the wine, Mark and the
Figshare investors. I also snaffled a few T-Shirts from a later event (
<a href="http://www.edinpubconf.net/program.html">Disruption In The Publishing Industry: Digital, Analytics &amp; The
Future</a> ) to give to people
back home.</p>

<h2>Conference Theme, leading to discussions about sustainability</h2>
<p>The conference theme was <a href="http://or2014.helsinki.fi/?page_id=281"><strong>Towards Repository
Ecosystems</strong></a> <strong>.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Repository systems are but one part of the ecosystem in 21st century
research, and it is increasingly clear that no single repository will
serve as the sole resource for its community. How can repositories
best be positioned to offer complementary services in a network that
includes research data management systems, institutional and
discipline repositories, publishers, and the open Web? When should
service providers build to fill identified niches, and where should
they connect with related services?  How might these networks offer
services to support organizations that lack the resources to build
their own, or researchers seeking to optimize their domain workflows?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even if I say so myself, the <a href="http://alveo.edu.au/2014/07/alveo-presentation-open-repositories-2014/">presentation I
delivered</a>
for the <a href="http://alveo.edu.au/">Alveo</a> project (co-authored with others
on the team) was highly theme-appropriate; it was all about
researcher-needs driving the creation of a repository service as the hub
of a Virtual Research Environment, where the repository part is
important but it’s not the <em>whole point</em> .</p>
<p>I had trouble getting to see many papers, given the dev-wrangling, but
there was definitely a lot of eco-system-ish work going on, as <a href="http://connect.clir.org/blogs/jon-dunn/2014/06/26/opening-open-repositories">reported
by Jon
Dunn</a>
:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many sessions addressed how digital repositories can fit into a larger
ecosystem of research and digital information. A <a href="https://www.conftool.com/or2014/index.php?page=browseSessions&amp;form_session=51">panel on ORCID
implementation
experiences</a>
showed how this technology could be used to tie publications and data
in repositories to institutional identity and access management
systems, researcher profiles, current research information systems,
and dissertation submission workflows; similar discussions took place
around DOIs and other identifiers. Other sessions addressed the role
of institutional repositories beyond traditional research outputs to
address <a href="https://www.conftool.com/or2014/index.php?page=browseSessions&amp;form_session=33">needs in teaching and learning and administrative
settings</a>
and <a href="https://www.conftool.com/or2014/index.php?page=browseSessions&amp;form_session=60">issues of interoperability and aggregation among content in
multiple repositories and other
systems</a>
.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One session I did catch (and not just 'cos I was chairing it) had a
presentation by Adam Field and Patrick McSweeney on <a href="http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/364266/">Micro data
repositories: increasing the value of research on the
web</a> (Field and McSweeney, 2014).
This has direct application to what we need to do in eResearch, Adam
reported on their experience setting up bespoke repository systems for
individual research projects, with a key ingredient missing in a lot of
such systems; maintenance and support from central IT. We’re trying to
do something similar at the University of Western Sydney, replicating
the success of a working-data repository at one of our institutes
(<a href="http://eresearch.uws.edu.au/blog/2013/07/24/4a-data-management-acquiring-acting-on-archiving-advertising-research-data-at-the-university-of-western-sydney/">reported at
OR2013</a>)
across the rest of the university, I’ll talk more to Adam and Patrick
about this.</p>
<p>For me the most important conversation at the conference was around
sustainability. We are seeing more research-oriented repositories and
Virtual Research Environments like Alveo, and it’s not always clear how
these are to be maintained and sustained.</p>
<p>Way back, when OR was mainly about Institutional Publications
Repositories (simply called Institutional Repositories, or IRs) we
didn’t worry so much about this; the IR typically lived in The Library,
the IR was full of documents and The Library already had a mission to
keep documents. Therefore the Library can look after the IR. Simple.</p>
<p>But as we move into a world of data repository services there are new
challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Data collections are usually bigger than PDF files, many orders of
magnitude bigger in fact, making it much more of an issue to say
“we’ll commit to maintaining this ever-growing pile of data”:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“There’s no I in data repostory (sic)” – i.e. many data repositories
are cross-institutional which means that there is no single
institution to sustain a repository and collaboration agreements are
needed. This is much, much more complicated that a single library
saying “We’ll look after that”.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And as noted above, there are commercial entities like Figshare and
Digital Science realizing that they can place themselves right in the
centre of this new data-economy. I assume they’re thinking about how to
make their paid services an indispensable part of doing research, in the
way that journal subscriptions and citation metrics services are, never
mind the conflict of interest inherent in the same organization running
both.</p>
<p>Some libraries are stepping up and offering data services, for example,
work between large US libraries.</p>

<p><strong>The dinner venue</strong></p>

<section>
<h2>The developer challenge</h2>
<p>This year we had a decent range of entries for the dev challenge, after
a fair bit of tweeting and some friendly matchmaking by yours truly.
This is the third time we’ve run the thing a clearly articulated <a href="http://or2014.helsinki.fi/?page_id=756#why-do-we-run-this-thing-and-why-should-i-join-in">set of
values about what we’re trying to
achieve</a>
.</p>
<p>All the entrants are listed here, with the winners noted in-line. I
won’t repeat them all here, but wanted to comment on a couple.</p>
<p>The <strong>people’s choice winner</strong> was a collaboration between a person with
an idea, Kara Van Malssen from AV Preserve in NY, and a developer from
the University of Queensland, Cameron Green, to <a href="http://or2014.helsinki.fi/?page_id=901#idea10">build a tool to check
up on the (surprisingly) varied results given by video characterization
software</a> . This team
personified the goals of the challenge, creating a new network, while
scratching an itch, and impressing the conference-goers who gathered
with beer and cider to watch the spectacle of ten five-minute pitches.</p>
<p>My personal favorite came from an idea that I pitched (see the <a href="http://or2014.helsinki.fi/?page_id=901">ideas
page</a> ) was the Fill My List
framework, which is a start on the idea of a ‘ <a href="http://or2014.helsinki.fi/?page_id=901#idea9">Universal Linked Data
metadata
lookup/autocomplete</a> ’.
We’re actually picking up this code and using it at UWS. So while the
goal of the challenge is not to get free software development for the
organizers that happened in this case (yes, this conflict of interest
was declared at the judging table). Again this was a cross-institutional
team (some of whom had worked together and some of whom had not). It was
nice that two of the participants, Claire Knowles of Edinburgh and Kim
Shepard of Auckland Uni were able to attend a <a href="http://ptsefton.com/2014/06/26/we-are-not-dinosaurs.htm">later event on my trip at
a hackfest in
Edinburgh</a> .
There’s a <a href="https://github.com/gobfrey/OR2014-chalege">github page with links to
demos</a>.</p>
<p>But, there’s a problem. The challenge seems to be increasingly hard work
to run, with fewer entries arising spontaneously at recent events. I
talked this over with members of the committee and others. There seem to
be a range of factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The conference may just be more interesting to a developer audience
than it used to be. Earlier iterations had a lot more content in the
main sessions about ‘what is a(n) (institutional) repository’ and
‘how do I promote my repository and recruit content’ whereas now we
see quite detailed technical stuff more often.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Developers are often heavily involved in the pre-conference
workshops leaving no time to attend a hack day to kick of the
conference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Travel budgets are tighter so if developers do end up being the ones
sent they’re expected to pay attention and take notes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m going to be a lot less involved in the OR committee etc next year,
as I will be focusing on helping out with <a href="http://adho.org/announcements/2013/digital-humanities-2015-be-held-sydney-australia">Digital Humanities
2015</a>
at UWS. I’m looking forward to seeing what happens next in the evolution
of the developer stream at the OR conference. At least it’s not a clash.</p>
<p>The Open Repositories Conference (OR2015) will take place in
Indianapolis, Indiana, USA at the Hyatt Regency from June 8-11, 2015.
The conference is being jointly hosted by <a href="http://www.libraries.iub.edu/">Indiana University
Libraries</a> , <a href="http://www.library.illinois.edu/">University of Illinois
Urbana-Champaign Library</a> , and
<a href="http://www.lib.vt.edu/">Virginia Tech University Libraries</a> .</p>

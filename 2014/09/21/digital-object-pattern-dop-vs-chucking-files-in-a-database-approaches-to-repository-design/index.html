<h1> 
Digital Object Pattern (DOP) vs chucking files in a database, approaches to repository design 
</h1>
<h2>2014-09-21 </h2>

<p>At work, in the eResearch team at the University of Western Sydney we've
been discussing various software options for working-data repositories
for research data, and holding a series of 'tool days'; informal
hack-days where we try out various software packages. For the last few
months we've been looking at &quot;working-data repository&quot; software for
researchers in a
<a href="http://eresearch.uws.edu.au/blog/2014/08/08/principles-for-eresearch-systems-development-and-selection/">principled</a>
way, searching for one or more perfect <a href="http://eresearch.uws.edu.au/blog/2014/09/11/who-is-dora/">Digital Object Repositories for
Academe</a>
(DORAs).</p>
<p>One of the things I've been ranting on about is the flexibility of the
&quot;Digital Object Pattern&quot;, (we <em>always</em> need more acronyms, so lets call
it DOP) for repository design, as implemented by the likes of ePrints,
DSpace, Omeka, CKAN and many of the Fedora Commons based repository
solutions. At its most basic, this means a repository that is built
around a core set of objects (which might be called something like an
Object, an ePrint, an Item, or a Data Set depending on which repository
you're talking to). These Digital Objects have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Object level Metadata</li>
<li>One or more 'files' or 'datastreams' or 'bitstreams', which may
themselves be metadata. Depending on the repository these may or may
not have their own metadata.</li>
</ul>
<div class="figure">
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/dop-basic.png" alt="Basic DOP Pattern">
Basic DOP Pattern</p>
</div>
<p>There are infinite ways to model a domain but this is a tried-and-tested
pattern which is worth exploring for any repository, if only because
it's such a common abstraction that lots of protocols and user interface
conventions have grown up around it.</p>
<p>I found this <a href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/january10/reilly/01reilly.html">discussion of the Digital
Object</a> used in
a CNRI, Digital Object Repository Server (DORS), obviously a cousin of
<a href="http://eresearch.uws.edu.au/blog/2014/09/11/who-is-dora/">DORA</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This data structure allows an object to have the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a set of key-value attributes that describe the object, one of
which is the object's identifier</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a set of named 'data elements' that hold potentially large byte
sequences (analogous to one or more data files)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a set of key-value attributes for each of the data elements</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This relatively simple data structure allows for the simple case, but
is sufficiently flexible and extensible to incorporate a wide variety
of possible structures, such as an object with extensive metadata, or
a single object which is available in a number of different formats.
This object structure is general enough that existing services can
easily map their information-access paradigm onto the structure, thus
enhancing interoperability by providing a common interface across
multiple and diverse information and storage systems. An example
application of the DO data model is illustrated in Figure 1.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/january10/reilly/DO-Overview-Figure1.png" alt=""></p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>To the above list of features and advantages I'd add a couple of points
on how to implement the <em>ideal</em> Digital Object repository:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every modern repository should make it easy for people to do linked
data. Instead of merely key-value attributes that describe the
object, it would be better to allow for and encourage RDF-style
predicate / object metadata where both the predicate and object are
HTTP URIs with human-friendly labels. This is implemented natively
in Fedora Commons v4. But when you are using the DOP it's not
<em>essential</em> as you can always add an RDF metadata data-element/file.</li>
<li>It's nice if the files also get metadata as in the CNRI Digital
Object, but using the DOP you can always add 'file' that describes
the file relationships rather than relying on conventions like
file-extensions or suffixes to say stuff like &quot;This is a thumbnail
preview of img01.jpg&quot;</li>
<li>There really should be a way to do relationships with other objects
but again, the DOP means you can DIY this feature with a
'relationships' data element.</li>
</ul>
<p>(I'm trying to keep this post reasonably short, but just quickly,
another really good repository pattern that complements DOP is to keep
separate the concerns of <em>Storing Stuff</em> from <em>Indexing Stuff for Search
and Browse</em>. That is, the Digital Objects should be stashed somewhere
with all their metadata and data, and no matter what metadata type
you're using you build one or more discovery indexes from that. This is
worth mentioning because as soon as some people see
<em><a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</a></em> they immediately think <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplestore">Triple
Store</a></em>, OK, but for
repository design I think it's more helpful to think <em>Triple Index</em>.
That is, treat the RDF reasoner, SPARQL query endpoint etc as a separate
concern from <em>repositing</em>.)</p>
<p>The DOP contrasts with a file-centric pattern where every file is
modelled separately, with it's own metadata, which is the approach taken
by HIEv, the environmental science Working Data Repository <a href="http://eresearch.uws.edu.au/blog/2014/09/04/is-hiev-adorable/">we looked at
last
week</a>.
Theoretically, this gives you infinite flexibility but in practice it
makes it harder to build a usable data repository.</p>
<div class="figure">
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/file-pattern.png" alt="Files as primary repository
objects">
Files as primary repository objects</p>
</div>
<p>Once your repository starts having a lot of stuff in it like image
thumbnails, derived files like OCRed text, and transcoded versions of
files (say from the proprietary TOA5 format into
<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/">NETCDF</a>) then you're
faced with the challenge of indexing them all, for search and browse in
a way that they appear to clump together. I think that as HIEv matures
and more and more relationships between files become important then
we'll probably want to add container objects that automatically bundle
together all the related bits and pieces to do with a single 'thing' in
the repository. For example, a time series data set may have the
original proprietary file format, some rich metadata, a derived file in
a standard format, a simple plot to preview the file contents, and
re-sampled data set at lower resolution, all of which really have more
or less the same metadata about where they came from, when, and some
shared utility. So, we'll probably end up with something like this:</p>
<div class="figure">
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/file-object-pattern.png" alt="Adding an abstraction to group files into Objects (once the UI gets
unmanageable)">
Adding an abstraction to group files into Objects (once the UI gets
unmanageable)</p>
</div>
<p>Draw a box around that and what have you got?</p>
<p>The Digital Object Pattern, that's what, albeit probably implemented in
a somewhat fragile way.</p>
<p>With the DOP, as with any repository implementation pattern you have to
make some design decisions. Gerry Devine asked at our tools day this
week, what do you do about data-items that are referenced by multiple
objects?</p>
<p>First of all, it is possible for one object to reference another, or
data elements in another, but if there's a lot of this going on then
maybe the commonly re-used data elements could be put in their own
object. A good example of this is the way WordPress, which is probably
where you're reading this, works. All images are uploaded into a media
collection, and then referenced by posts and pages: an image doesn't
'belong' to a document except by association, if the document calls it
in. This is a common approach for content management systems, allowing
for re-use of assets across objects, but if you were building a museum
collection project with a Digital Object for each physical artefact, it
might be better for practical reasons to store images of objects as data
elements on the object, and other images which might be used for context
etc separately as image objects.</p>
<p>Of course if you're a really hardcore developer you'll probably want to
implement the most flexible possible pattern and put one file per
object, with a 'master object' to tie them together. This makes
development of a usable repository significantly harder. BTW, you can do
it using the DOP with one-file per Digital Object, and lots of
relationships. Just be prepared for orders of magnitude more work to
build a robust, usable system.</p>

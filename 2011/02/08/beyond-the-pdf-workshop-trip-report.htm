<p>A couple of weeks ago I was in San Diego, USA for the Beyond the PDF
meeting. Other parts of the country were a bit snowed under, but in San
Diego it was like a Brisbane winter, with students at UCSD getting
around in shorts and ugg boots. The trip was paid for by my employer,
USQ, although I was handed a reimbursement form for some of the expenses
so we may be able to claim some of it back.</p>
<p>In this post I'll look at the goals of the meeting what I contributed,
what I thought of it and what might happen next.</p>
<h1><span id="id2"></span><!--id2--></a>The Goal</h1>
<p>From the website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The goal of the workshop was not to produce a white paper! Rather it
was to identify a set of requirements, and a group of willing
participants to develop a mandate, open source code and a set of
deliverables to be used by scholars to accelerate data and knowledge
sharing and discovery . Our starting point, and the only prerequisite
to participating, was the belief that we need to move Beyond the
PDF (meant to capture a common philosophy, not necessarily to be taken
literally).</p>
<p>In a heady moment we might also describe our efforts as the desire to
contribute to the development of a free and open digital printing
press for the 21st century. A platform, when utilized, moves us beyond
a static and disparate data and knowledge representation to a rich
integrated content which grows and changes the more we learn. A system
(content plus platform) from which a scholar can interact and once
evaluated shows improved understanding and interest.</p>
<p><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/beyondthepdf">https://sites.google.com/site/beyondthepdf</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I said on the list before the conference what my aims were:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. What at the end of three days do you want to have achieved by
attending the workshop?</p>
<p>I'd like to see (a) some progress in defining at least one
re-engineered scholarly process for data-supported research
publication, which will meet the current needs of researchers for
recognition via traditional metrics and have a clear business model
(in the broad sense) as well as show the way to the future of
data-integrated, reproducible research, and (b) properly resourced
projects to begin implementing at least one such model.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
2. How do you see the workshop contributing to your goals in
contributing to scholarly communication in the next 1-3 years?</p>
<p>I hope the workshop can assist us with prioritizing and planning the
various strands of our open source work on authoring tools, annotation
and multi-format repositories. I note that one of the most useful
signals for such prioritization would be funding that meets the goals
in 1.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think we made some progress on (1), and there is some hope for (2)
<span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> we have a demonstration system
that my team is putting together now, and we can see if that can be used
as a platform for funding applications, and as a way to generate feature
requests from the Beyond the PDF community.</p>
<p>I put in an <a href="http://ptsefton.com/2010/12/09/beyond-the-pdf-proposed-session-bring-the-web-to-the-researcher-mainly-on-authoring-tools.htm">long abstract for a
presentation</a>
which covered how I think the suite of systems built by my team can
contribute to open, data-supported research and publication process. The
presentation slots were only 15 minutes, though, with just ten for the
presentation part so I tried to look more at some of the issues and try
to start some discussion, and assume that people would read the
presentation and get a sense of the scope of the tools we have built.
Not sure that approach really worked. I think I might have been better
off doing a demo <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> as I got a much
better reaction from the demo I did to the writing tools group late in
the conference than I did to my talk. You can <a href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=BE627F48A0DB94FD">watch on
YouTube</a> if
you really want to, but I recommend
<a href="http://ptsefton.com/2010/12/09/beyond-the-pdf-proposed-session-bring-the-web-to-the-researcher-mainly-on-authoring-tools.htm">reading</a>
over listening to me rush through the stuff I wanted to say, going 'ah,
um' a lot in workshop thinking on feet mode.</p>
<p>I have attached my presentation to this post using our the ReDBox
research data management system that we'll be using as a demonstrator
<span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> the PowerPoint has been ironed out
into a series of pictures, imagine the same for spreadsheets and other
data in the research artefact of the future.</p>
<p>I tried to hit important themes rather than specifics. One point I
wanted to make was that we can't assume that if you build it, they will
come. That is, we can make what we think are nice commodious systems for
researchers but <em>nice</em> is not enough. I used the analogy of a chook
house (that's chicken coop to you non-antipodeans) <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> I showed a picture of one my family
built for our chooks to live in, so they don't get eaten by someone's
dog and so the eggs get laid in the right place. But this summer we have
had a trio of young pullets who went a bit feral. We didn't have time to
teach them to live in the house with the old girls before we went on
holidays, and they ended up sleeping in trees, and laying eggs under the
house, and lately the trampoline, and maybe other places. This is
soluble, we (think) we know how to manage the flock, and teach them to
live happily in their chook house, but the point is that the chooks
didn't use the purpose built chook facility just because we built it.
The repository crowd will know what I'm talking about.</p>
<p>In a similar vein Phil Bourne, the workshop organiser kept reminding us
to consider reward mechanisms, it's no use building 'better' systems
that don't suit the researchers, we need to give them reason to use
them. In the case of scholarly communications, though, this is BIG
change and there are very entrenched players and processes so change is
slow and hard. I know from reading and hanging around with Peter
Murray-Rust just how hard this change is proving to be in chemistry, but
there are success stories like the <a href="http://www.plos.org/">Public Library of
Science</a> where Open Access publishing has started
to catch on. There was some talk of build Beyond the PDF stuff on the
PLOS platform.</p>
<p>The workshop was a lot to take in, like most conferences, but this one
was very focussed. Still, trying to follow both the in-room discussion
and try to assimilate all the new and challenging stuff and the
twitter-fall was very challenging. I can't hope to capture all of it.</p>
<h1><span id="id3"></span><!--id3--></a>Outcomes</h1>
<p>The site says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Short talks
(see <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/beyondthepdf/home/program-draft">program</a>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/beyondthepdf/webcasts">webcasts</a>, <a href="http://friendfeed.com/beyondthepdf">twitterfeed</a> and
<a href="http://archivist.visitmix.com/jschneider/1">twitter archive</a>) were
followed by discussion and the major issues identified leading to a La
Jolla Manifesto (under review) and a set of deliverables to move us
towards common goals. One major goal is to use our tools to have some
positive impact on the understanding and treatment of spinal muscular
atrophy (<a href="http://smafoundation.org/">SMA</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The workshop has spawned a series of working parties looking at
different issues.</p>
<p>The two I have paid the most attention to, and the two which have
c<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/beyondthepdf/home/program-draft/notes-from-the-breakout">ontent on the web site at the breakout session
page</a>
are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Research objects</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The central focal point of this discussion was focussed
on <strong>nanopublications</strong> as a computable representation of
scientific assertions with added provenance information. We
consider '<strong>Research objects</strong>' (attempting to follow on from the
definition provided in the MyExperiment link above) to act as
holders of several data artifacts (that may or may not have
semantic structure; including PDF files, excel spreadsheets, text
files, <em>etc.</em>) *as well as any nanopublications that we might add
to the data as annotations. *Note that this action of annotating
non-semantic elements of a research object with nanopublications
provides us with an incremental way of adding our additional
content to existing data.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There were some people at the workshop who are very interested in being
able to represent scientific claims as formal RDF statements
(<a href="http://laikaspoetnik.wordpress.com/2010/06/23/will-nano-publications-triplets-replace-the-classic-journal-articles/">nanopublications</a>),
the idea being that we will have machine readable, and perhaps machine
understandable science (it was all science <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> hardly a mention of the humanities that
I heard). My opinion is that formal semantics are almost certainly
useful at the level of statements like <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>Peter Sefton wrote this document<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> and may prove to be useful in some of
the hard sciences. I keep arguing that one of the places we should start
to build semantic web or nanopublication experience in metadata where we
have known, identifiable (but as yet not consistently identified)
parties (researchers, publishers etc) and identifiable versionable
products (papers, data sets, pictures etc) that can be related to each
other with formal statements. These are universal to all research and
scholarship. If we can start to reason just at the level of who wrote
what, and what data sets belong where then that's a good start. But
that's a big if <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> metadata is hard
enough without adding RDF to the mix.</p>
<p>I want to start with metadata, then maybe we can move on to dealing with
how to get machines to reason about statements like <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>Mosquitoes transmit maleria<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>; where the arguments get pretty
complicated pretty quickly.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Breakout Group: Writing [I was in this one]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The writing group decided that we should aim for developing a
common tool (or set of tools), rather than to work on several
independent projects, or just a set of standards, protocols, etc.
The requirements for the tool we want to develop are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>help with a major bottleneck in creating scholarly content</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be as simple as possible (low hanging fruit, try to solve 80%
of the use cases, go for the long tail in small labs, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have a working prototype no later than in 6 months</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be useful for all scholarly disciplines</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
\</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<h1><span id="id4"></span><!--id4--></a>Back at ADFI</h1>
<p>These are the things I will be working on with my team:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Setting up a demonstrator of ReDBox (The Fascinator application for
describing research data) watching a shared DropBox folder as part
of the demo platform for the writing workshop. This will show how
researchers can make their stuff part of the web (but private), sort
it out, package it, and provide a platform where we can start
talking about what to do next:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What are the parts of a research object?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do we capture semantics in our word processor?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do we provide services for automated markup and annotation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where do you send a research object to start the publication
process?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the 'publication process'.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ditto with the Admiral project for Cambridge [Update 2011-02-10 -
<a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/mrd/rdmi/admiral.aspx">Admiral</a>
is at Oxford] which provides managed research data storage packaged
as a virtual machine. The Admiral work is potentially a useful
component for ReDBox installation such as that at Newcastle, so we
should explore it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="id6"></span><!--id6--></a>Demonstrator architecture</h2>
<p><a name="Object1"><!-- --></a><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/btpdf-tripreport_filesm71d3b2d7_450x290.jpg.jpeg" alt="OLE-object" /></p>
<h2><span id="id7"></span><!--id7--></a>Benefits for USQ</h2>
<p>The work we're doing on on the using ReDBox to manage files on a shared
drive will:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Directly benefit USQ's researchers as we undertake our
<a href="http://ands.org.au/">ANDS</a> Seeding the Commons project, which will
demonstrate data management best practice via a pilot, and generate
new USQ policy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Potentially benefit our online teachers and students by giving them
very low-friction ways to create web resources and open educational
resources including packages of multiple parts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continue to build the ADFI Software R&amp;D team's reputation and
standing as a leader in scholarly technology work.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1><span id="id9"></span><!--id9--></a>Some issues I want to follow up</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Someone from one of the big publishers said to me, talking about
business models <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>basically we
curate and filter stuff<span class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>. I
thought that sounds like what libraries do (in addition to
functioning as coffee lounges <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span>
sorry, I mean <em>learning commons</em> <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> with bean bags and internets <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> seriously though, I said this before
on the CAIRSS blog, <a href="http://cairss.caul.edu.au/blog/2010/12/22/thoughts-from-eresearch-australasia-librarians-get-involved-in-research-data-management-2/">librarians should be getting
involved</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There's clearly a debate to have on the benefits of HTML vs XML vs
PDF as the format of record, for different purposes and at different
stages in the research lifecycle, and some design work on new
formats and interop options.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mid last year <a href="http://ptsefton.com/2010/08/13/epub-as-a-way-of-packaging-scholarly-resources.htm">I proposed that we look at Epub as a packaging format
for scholarly
communications</a>
but didn't really do anything about it. I'm pleased to say that
momentum is picking up on this. After Beyond the PDF Martin Fenner
<a href="http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/01/23/beyond-the-pdf-%E2%80%A6-is-epub/">talked about
ePub</a>,
then <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/02/01/epub-wordpress-plugin-released-today/">implemented a save-as ePub for
WordPress</a>.
I really want to look at interop between the work he's doing and our
demonstrator <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> resources
permitting. Reminder: there is a screenshot of some of the stuff
from the workshop demo files, packaged as ePub, in <a href="http://ptsefton.com/2010/12/09/beyond-the-pdf-proposed-session-bring-the-web-to-the-researcher-mainly-on-authoring-tools.htm">my
talk</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And finally, in breaking news <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span>
it looks like I might be in the UK for a hackfest around the weekend
of the 11^th^ of march, with a theme along the lines of Hacking /
exploring Scholarly HTML, sponsored by Peter Murray-Rust's group at
Cambridge. More on that soon.</p>

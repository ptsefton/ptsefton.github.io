<p>Following from <a href="http://ptsefton.com/2011/02/08/beyond-the-pdf-workshop-trip-report.htm">my
attendance</a>
at the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/beyondthepdf/">Beyond the PDF</a>
workshop in January, I've been invited to Cambridge by Peter
Murray-Rust. That's where I am now. (We have two just under weeks to
revolutionise scholarly communications :) Peter has organized a hackfest
for the weekend of March 12^th^ and 13^th^ and the theme is <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span><a href="http://ptsefton.com/2009/03/31/scholarly-html.htm">Scholarly
HTML</a><span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> - something I have been writing about,
but doing much about for a while now.</p>
<p>What's Scholarly HTML?</p>
<p>I think it's a way of representing 'research objects' along with
associated data and metadata, <strong>for the web</strong>, so they can be
efficiently created, then reviewed, discussed, machine processed, copied
and do on. Scholarly HTML is a way to encapsulate research objects in a
portable, preservable and sustainable way using simple technologies so
that research can be not just <em>on</em> the web but <em>of</em> the web.</p>
<p>What I hope to do at the hackfest is map out some guidelines for what
Scholarly HTML might look like and then start working out how to author
it, and how to present it. And how to do scholarship on top of it. Open
review, machine processing, nanopublications <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> these things all need a platform. Yes
you can do these things in PDF, if you write new PDF viewers and so on,
but it is so much easier to use the web. That's what the web was
originally for, after all. Yes, I will be talking about word processors,
and our work on desktop repositories. And yes Martin Fenner will be
looking at WordPress and PMR's team are looking at machine generated
journals <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> but I think it's really
important to think about what we want in an underlying <em>format</em>.
Something that can be preserved and exchanged and made to work in
different systems.</p>
<p>(I think that sometimes the format itself is hard to see when you are
looking at tools like WordPress which are both authoring tool and
publishing environment but it is doubly important in that case to make
sure that what we're creating is not locked in to a particular platform.
How would you archive a document which depends on eight CMS plugins to
work? How sustainable is a journal that requires multiple CMS plugins?
I'm not saying the folks working on tools now are not thinking about
these issues, just emphasising that we will be thinking about hard about
separating tools from formats and considering interoperability at the
workshop. That includes 'interop with the future' AKA digital
preservation.)</p>
<p>In scope for the <em>format</em> Scholarly HTML:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Articles, theses, reports, lab notebooks, blog posts</strong>, which
reference associated stuff such as data and provenance and anything
else that makes research reproducible and/or able to be validated.
Peter Murray-Rust contributed this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is critical that the tool [I think he should have said <em>format</em>
rather than <em>tool</em> here] supports easy aggregation and publication
of data as part of the article. This includes the following - in
text</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>tables in some accepted format (CSV, *.tex are most common)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bit-map images (micrographs, gels, galaxies...)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>vector graphics (SVG, ?WMF, etc.). Plots, apparatus, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>maths - equations, variables, code</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>chemistry - CML and other Open markup languages (PubchemXML?0</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>maps (GML, coordinates)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>supplemental files. All the above and more</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br>
\</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Structure and semantics for document contents</strong>, like headings,
being able to label parts <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> like
<span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>This bit is a <em>Method<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span></em> where <em>Method</em> is well defined
using a URI and extensible methods for describing relations between
and within objects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ways to <strong>represent citations in an unambiguous machine readable
way</strong> so that readers can have them presented in ways of their own
choosing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Techniques for embedding domain semantics</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Packaging</strong> so that research objects can be moved around, saved,
posted, etc. This is going beyond HTML, I know, but it's one of the
great unsolved problems of the web. I've <a href="http://ptsefton.com/2010/08/13/epub-as-a-way-of-packaging-scholarly-resources.htm">talked about this
before</a>
<span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> and <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/01/23/beyond-the-pdf-%E2%80%A6-is-epub/">Martin Fenner has picked
up the Epub ball and taken it for a good
run</a>.
More soon on this but just as a teaser, I'm now thinking of
proposing that a minimal scholarly HTML package might consist of a
zip file with at least one file at the root, index.html, which can
link other pages if it wants. This is inspired by Eprints and by the
simple standards such as
<a href="https://confluence.ucop.edu/display/Curation/BagIt">Bagit</a>
developed at the California Digital Libraries. This is a minimum
<span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> the package could also be an
ePub and have a formal ORE manifest etc. Chris Rusbridge <a href="http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2011/03/08/scholarly-html-hackfest/#comment-94093">mentioned
the importance of packaging over on Peter Murray-Rust's
blog</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="spCh spChx2026">…</span> My concern re Scholarly HTML
relates to the difficulty in saving an article in HTML and then
accessing it later (one of PDF<span
class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>s big advantages is that it does
this simply and reliably). Safari does this well with .webarchive
but it<span class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>s non-standard and no
other browsers support this. Most use a really clumsy convention
with a .html file and an associated directory; not very easy to
manage.</p>
<p>So my suggestion to help Scholarly HTML would be a plugin (eg for
Firefox) or filter that converts Scholarly HTML articles to .epub
(eg see mfenner<span class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>s plugin for
epub from WordPress).</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Related to the format, but not actually part of Scholarly HTML:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Annotations on the above</strong>, where annotation is taken in the
broadest possible sense. Scholarly HTML needs to worry about anchors
for annotation. Annotation can be used for peer and open review,
inline discussion at all stages of a research object life cycle,
adding formal semantics and lots of other scholarly processes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tools, tools tools.</strong> Word, WordPress and anything else that
starts with W, maybe even some things that don't. I want to be able
to work on papers in OpenOffice and post them to collaboration
spaces <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> including WordPress, so
I think a lot of the hackfest should be about interop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Authoring tricks and techniques.</strong> Stuff like
<a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/kcite/">KCite</a> where you can
add citations in any-old editor using text [ [cite
source='pubmed']17237047[/cite], and my approach of using links to
embed document semantics, like this assertion that I am the author
of this post:</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Browser-side plugins to make declarative Scholarly HTML come
alive</strong>. There are some problems with browser-side code,
particularly when various scripts get in each other's way, but one
of the big pluses is that it can work across more than one system
really easily, so you don't just get a WordPress plugin, you get
something that can be added to any system or turned into an app for
offline use.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Important properties of scholarly HTML:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>It's declarative</strong>. That is if we are linking a document to, say,
a map then the document will contain:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>At least, a link to the map, which must be in a standard format.
The link will be labelled in some way to say <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>I am a link to a map<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>, maybe with further attached
semantics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optionally a static placeholder image for the map so that any
old web browser can be used to at least show something.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Systems for rendering Scholarly HTML will know how to interpret the
semantics that there is a map, or a molecule on the end of the link
and do something useful. A web page containing Javascript tied
directly to Google Maps doesn't qualify <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> it's not portable. (But as Phillip
Lord pointed out in email, if the basic declarative stuff is there
then it should be OK to have the script as well.)</p>
<p>Another example of where a declarative spec is important is
citations. Scholarly HTML will have a way to represent citations
<span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> there's a really <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/wordpress-for-scientists/msg/d5ab1ba17fde62d6">useful
discussion going on of the issues around
this</a>
on the wordpress-for-scientists@googlegroups.com list. Martin Fenner
is committed to working on a tool that can find citations in text
and format them, this <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/03/07/the-trouble-with-bibliographies/">will be a web
service</a>.
I think we can use the workshop to <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/citation">progress work on microformats
for citation</a> and at least
consider some of the questions about what are reliable end points
for citations and how much potentially redundant bibliographic data
to store in the Scholarly HTML.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It has a <strong>simple structural backbone</strong>, using HTML 5 elements to
give the basic hierarchy with optionally much more detail. Using the
<a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-article-element">HTML article
element</a>,
it should be possible to identify the bounds of a work, and separate
it from navigation and branding.</p>

More thoughts on thesis embargoes

<p>I wrote last time about <a href="http://ptsefton.com/2008/12/02/embargoes-on-bits-of-theses-skating-on-thin-ice.htm">how we might do thesis embargoes with
ICE</a>
as part of the TheOREM-ICE project we're doing with Jim Downing and team
at Cambridge. That post was mostly about why we wouldn't want to add
complex access control at a very granular level to ICE.</p>
<p>I'm actually in Cambridge now and I've talked the issue over with Jim
Downing and Nick Day. We think we've come up with a workable,
implementable prototype for thesis embargo which I'll describe here. But
first some background about the requirements.</p>
<p>We've been whiteboarding thesis workflow with three broad stages;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Dafting, where a small group have access to the emerging document
plus its data. The group could be as small as one candidate and one
supervisor but others may be allowed in. We don't need fine grained
access control for this bit and embargoes are not relevant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Examination, where the thesis goes off to examiners. Again you don't
want to embargo anything or what would they be examining? There will
be some indication of which bits are <em>going to be</em> embargoed though
so examiners can take care not to talk about those bits to others.
Access control is crucial, but so is management of the examiners and
managing their feedback. It's not clear that we would want to add
these features to ICE, maybe to <a href="http://pkp.org/">OJS</a>?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making public, where we do need to worry about embargoes. At this
stage the content should be out of the drafting system; this is what
the ARROW people called crossing the curation boundary.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>While we were talking about this it came to light that one of the theses
that we're looking at for the TheOREM-ICE project has a rather unusual
embargo requirement. The thesis is OK to go on the web apart from the
acknowledgements section which is apparently considered by the author to
be a private matter. The solution we came up with will deal with that.</p>
<p>Here it is:</p>
<p>In ICE each chapter/part of the document will be a separate document, in
Word or OpenOffice.org writer, as per the way ICE does courseware. This
is much safer for book-length content than trying to use Word on a
single file, anyway.</p>
<p>The candidate will enter embargo information into each chapter using the
techniques outlined in our joint<a href="http://www.dspace.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/206423">paper that Jim Downing recently
delivered at the IDCC conference in
Edinburgh</a>. That is, at
the top of each file will be a place to put some embargo information. We
have to work out how this will look but it will be something like:</p>
<div class="Table1"
style="width: 100%; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; text-align:left;">
<p>+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
| Embargo period (in months)           | 6                                    |
|                                      |                                      |
| -   Leave blank or put zero for no   |                                      |
|     embargo                          |                                      |
|                                      |                                      |
| -   Put -1 for indefinite embargo    |                                      |

<p>This is human readable, so it will give cues to supervisors and
examiners about how the data are to be treated, but it will also be
machine readable so that downstream systems can be used to enforce the
embargos.</p>
<p>The downstream system we have in mind to demonstrate this is <a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/projects/fascinator/trac">The
Fascinator</a>, which was
designed for just this sort of thing.</p>
<p>Once the thesis is awarded, someone in authority will be able to click
the 'Make Public' button, which will push the content to an instance of
The Fascinator using an <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/ore/">OAI-ORE</a>
resource map to describe the contents of the thesis in excruciating
detail including the metadata about embargoes. The Fascinator will index
the embargo dates and enforce access controls using its normal approach
of limit queries. That is, the guest account will always have a query
like this added:</p>
<p>issue_date&lt;=$todays_date and total_embargo=false</p>
<p>This says make sure that we only show things issued on or before today
which are not under unconditional embargo. At the moment it seems like
the simplest solution for embargo dates will be to use the Dublin Core
issue date element. If an item has an issue date in the future then The
Fascinator will refuse to serve it to guests.</p>
<p>The openId field in the metadata example above is a place to capture an
identity that is controlled by the candidate so they can come back and
manage embargoes later, after their local institutional login may have
been turned off. We don't know how to store that metadata just yet.</p>
<p>We may not be able to implement all of this immediately because we're
coming up to the silly season in Australia, but I'm sure that we will be
able to demo parts of this scenario fairly quickly.</p>

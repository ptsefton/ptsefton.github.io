<p><a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/projects/fascinator/trac">The Fascinator</a> is a
bit of repository software, designed to show off stuff that resides in a
<a href="http://fedora-commons.org/">Fedora Commons</a>store. It was designed and
built at the <a href="http://www.usq.edu.au/adfi">Australian Digital Futures
Institute</a> at The University of Southern
Queensland (USQ). The software development was funded by the <a href="http://arrow.edu.au/">ARROW
project</a> with a contribution from USQ. It is based
on some work that was part of <a href="http://fred.usq.edu.au/">FRED</a> (Federated
Repositories for Education). None of it, including the ARROW software
would be possible without the Free and open source software on which it
was built and in particular the indexer for Fedora that the
<a href="http://www.muradora.org/muradora">Muradora</a> team adapted.</p>
<p>The Fascinator was largely written by Oliver Lucido, with task
management and web-skinning by Bron Chandler, and some programming on
the harvesting component from Tim McCallum, not to mention the
screencast. Neil Dickson at ARROW was our chief stakeholder. Also
holding a stake was Alison Dellit from the National Library of Australia
(NLA).</p>
<p>Why was The Fascinator relevant to the audience at
<a href="http://www.linkaffiliates.net.au/idea2008/index.html">!dea</a>? The motto
there was Enabling Technology: Forging a Digital Future <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> it was a cross-sectoral meeting for
educational technologists (at least that's what I thought it was).</p>
<p>I had to think about that a bit. In addition to covering the software I
tried to explore these themes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Talk about some contrasting software development/procurement
approaches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look at standards and interop in Higher Education, particularly how
the higher-ed sector has gone trying to harmonize standardize and
align their metadata.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is the <a href="http://www.e-framework.org/">e-Framework</a> any use to a dev
shop like ours? (If you don't know what that is, don't worry, the
e-Framework crowd can comment below if they like)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open Source as a conversation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To understand the motivation for The Fascinator we have to look a little
at the ARROW project. ARROW (Australian Research Repositories Online to
the World) was (it ends at the end of 2008) an Australian government
funded project. ARROW got involved in an interesting software
development model, partnering with a commercial systems vendor from the
USA to build some Institutional Repository software on top of an open
source base.</p>
<p>The result was an, um, <em>interesting</em> mix of free and commercial
software.</p>
<p>There was <a href="http://www.linkaffiliates.net.au/idea2008/events/speakers.html#vaughan">some talk on Thursday morning about building vs buying
technology</a>.
The ARROW-sponsored application was written as part of a complex
interaction in which some technology had been bought but some was open,
and we built something that complemented the bought bit and filled in
some gaps. That's much more complex that just 'build or buy'.</p>
<p>I 'm not up to expressing this in 'proper' eFramework-speak, but broadly
speaking the services the ARROW community are after include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Collection management; the ability to browse and search groups of
like or related things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Full text search.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simple access control such as on-campus access only to some kinds of
document, rather than more complex far-fetched requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Separate views or 'portals' for different campuses or purposes. One
thing that would be nice would be to separate images from documents
for example. Can I have a document portal and an image portal so I
don't keep seeing pictures of cathedrals when I want to read theses?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(Apparently one of the eFrameworkistas was working on a Service Usage
Model as I spoke. Can I see it please?)</p>
<p>The ARROW software, which is called VITAL, currently does 1 and 2 above,
and has very rudimentary support for 3, while 4 is a feature that is
coming in the new not yet released version 4 of VITAL.</p>
<p><span
style="display: block"><a name="graphics1"></a><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/15d786ac2.gif" alt="graphics1" /></span></p>
<p>While the VITAL software in the above diagram is represented as a nice
clean box, what goes on inside is probably rather complicated. Of course
it's not possible to find out exactly what VITAL does as it is a
proprietary closed-source product. What I know about VITAL comes from
talking to people from the vendor. I don't want to get into too many
specifics as I know the product is evolving and they might not like me
to share all of the things they have shared with me. I have based this
discussion on knowledge that is common to in the ARROW community.</p>
<p>Now the current version of VITAL can't fulfill all the requirements I
outlined above, but lets think about a imaginary repository at an
imaginary university <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> the
University of the East Coast. That institution might have a repository
which has multiple campuses (<a href="http://geohash.org/r3gx4mvw8bfz3">Bondi
Beach</a>, <a href="http://geohash.org/r7j0eqm4fssmq">Surfers
Paradise</a>, <a href="http://geohash.org/r7j5vycwmwn66">North Stradbroke
Island</a>, etc), and which has
'collections' of documents such as research articles or theses. Some of
the material is not for public consumption, such as theses which are
under embargo because they contain stuff that's patentable.</p>
<p>This diagram shows what I imagine might go in inside a repository as it
grinds through the process of doing a search. This involves doing four
separate lookups. I have no idea how VITAL really works so please don't
take this literally <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> it's a thought
experiment.</p>
<p>If I search for something, say the word <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>surfboard<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> in the thesis collection, from the
portal belonging to one of the campuses then:</p>
<p>First it must merge the results from three of its indexes;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A text index.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A collections index using the RDF triple-store.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And a portal table which might be implemented using a SQL database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When that's done it has to compare all the results to the access
policy store in a process know as post-filtering.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span
style="display: block"><a name="graphics2"></a><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/269b512f2.gif" alt="graphics2" /></span></p>
<p>When I gave this talk an audience member wanted to know why I wanted to
post-filter search results. Answer? I don't. This slide was to
illustrate the <strong>problem</strong> with this kind of architecture. Got that? I
don't think that the above is a very good idea unless you want to spend
a lot of time and resources on optimizing out all the problems. It's an
anti-pattern.</p>
<p>This example illustrates a potential problem with using an architecture
with multiple different indexes where queries need to be merged. The
application designers will either have to accept slow performance or
write a lot of optimizations themselves to merge all those results
(using the mergerator which is a word I just made up) from searches
against different indexes. This is complex, hard stuff.</p>
<p>The main problem with this architecture is post-filtering search results
for access control. The impact of having to do this could be very great
in some situations. I have concocted a ludicrous example to illustrate
this.</p>
<p>At the University of the East Coast, there's this rumour going around
that someone is onto a new kind of skeg with a special shape. In fact
there is a (very, stupidly,) large number of PhD theses that have been
written on the topic but they are all under embargo and the people who
wrote them are sworn to secrecy.</p>
<p>So when a designer from a surf company searches the uni repository it's
important not to reveal that, yes in fact we do have a lot of hits for
the search term 'helical skeg'.</p>
<p><a name="graphics3"></a><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/m6a8d0dd92.gif" alt="graphics3" /></p>
<p>You can tell that I made this example up, right? But it does illustrate
an important point. If you have some non open access content you need to
be very sure that you do not expose even the fact that you have a
document that contains a particular string.</p>
<p>This illustrates only what I see as a potential problem with using an
architecture with multiple different indexes where queries need to be
merged. The application designers will either have to accept slow
performance or write a lot of optimizations themselves. This is complex,
hard stuff.</p>
<p>The Fascinator takes a different approach; it uses just one technology
to the drive the search; Apache Solr. Want to do a text search? Apache
Solr. Limit results by campus? Apache Solr. Limit the amount of stuff
guests can see? Apache Solr.</p>
<p>One big advantage of this approach is that Solr already handles lots of
the internal caching of results. If you search for everything that
guests can see it remembers the result. If you search for everything
with an index entry of <code>Collection='thesis' </code>it can remember that. When
you perform a complex query smart programmers have already worked out
the fastest way to merge all the pre-cached results. It's built in.</p>
<p>Main features:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Flexible indexing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Faceted search.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New portals using facets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access control using facets.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span
style="display: block"><a name="graphics4"></a><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/m61e70f422.gif" alt="graphics4" /></span></p>
<p>You can see the Fascinator in action in a couple of places:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://rspilot.usq.edu.au:8080/the-fascinator/">Our demo site</a>.
Currently has content from a variety of places including the
Universit<span class="spCh spChxe9">é</span> catholique de Louvain
where we have harvest open content for demonstration purposes but
your mileage may vary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://aust-repos-census.usq.edu.au/the-fascinator/">The AURIC
site</a> where we
will eventually harvest all the Australian University Repositories
we can get our paws on.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Fascinator is mission-accomplished in terms of its goals, which were
really about making a proof-of-concept statement in an ongoing
conversation with the vendor and others in our repository community. We
could park it now and be happy <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> but
that would be a pity. It looks like the software could have a life
beyond the initial project; there has been interest expressed in a quite
a few places, but everyone involved needs to understand that support
from now on is based on whatever we can manage in between other
projects, unless we can work out a way to make it sustainable.</p>
<p><span
style="display: block"><a name="graphics5"></a><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/m2345ae82.gif" alt="graphics5" /></span></p>
<p>There are a couple of things we can do now:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use it as a simple portal for Fedora as part of a simple repository
along with the new Java version of VALET we're writing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explore how it might fit with other software, such as ePrints which
has a highly developed workflow for ingesting research outputs, or
Muradora which specializes in access control. There's no reason we
couldn't make The Fascinator work nicely as complements to these and
more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>See how it will work in the new (to us) world of eResearch data that
gets created in the lab or in the field and then must find its way
into long term storage and global sharing. I'm thinking of a sort of
'iTunes for research data and publishing' but without the lockin of
course.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider The Fascinator as the basis for a crowd-sourced history
project with Chris Lee of the Public Memory Research Centre at USQ
(he just got funding).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think about how we might index RDF, as there are lots of projects
starting to think RDF in the eResearch world.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In any case we will offer the indexing component, which we (meaning
Oliver) built on top of work by the Muradora team back to the Fedora
Commons community.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I offered the folks at !dea at 2008 the following. (Don't
think I really offered much re software development methodology):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I observed that from what I've heard about the vocational (VET)
sector they have done much better with metadata standardization.
From what I hear there<span class="T5"> was a bit of cynicism from
some people about that, but on the whole I think that's right <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> they're more focussed and have done
much better at aggregation and sharing.
</span><code>See </code><a href="http://lorn.flexiblelearning.net.au/Home.aspx">LORN</a><code>.</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I'm still not sure how I would use the
<a href="http://www.e-framework.org/">e-Framework</a> to design software <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> what we did here feels more like
improvisation; mashing up a couple well-known patterns. Sort of like
playing a Reggae song using country licks, which is what I do at
home as my hobby. But talking to Lyle Winton, he says that what we
have done is identify an anti-pattern (the <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>imagined architecture<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> above) and a new pattern which
works. The e-Framework team are welcome to use us as a case study...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This open source thing has been really important to us. Instead of
being stuck in conference rooms and conference calls trying to
explain to a software vendor what ARROW wants, we were able to spend
a comparatively small amount of money and say it with code, building
on what others have already done.</p>

<p>As with busses, sometimes you can wait ages for a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schematron">Schematron</a> and suddenly a
whole pack of them come along together<a href="#ftn0"><span
style="vertical-align: super;"><span
class="footnote">*</span></span></a>.</p>
<p>For those of you who don't know:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Markup Languages, Schematron is a rule-based validation language
for making assertions about the presence or absence of patterns in XML
trees. It is a simple and powerful structural schema language. It
typically uses XPath to describe patterns.</p>
<p>(Wikipedia contributors 2008)<span class="spCh spChx2060">⁠</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead of the all or nothing syntactic approach that you get with other
kinds of schemas Schematron lets you pick and choose things to worry
about. So instead of saying <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>all
course books must begin with a Learning Outcomes section<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> you can write a rule that simply reports
on whether there's a Learning Outcomes section or not without letting
there be any variation. Why? In some courses it might be important to
add something before that section while I have heard arguments that in
some situations specifying learning outcomes upfront scares off
potential students.</p>
<p>We've discussed using Schematron to provide reports on
<a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/">ICE</a> content but have never got around to using
it. This week it has resurfaced in couple of contexts.</p>
<p>Relevant to <strong>ICE as a course-authoring system</strong>, the Learning and
Teaching Support Group at USQ have a checklist, <em>The USQ course writing
guide</em><span style="font-style:normal; "><span class="T3"> which authors
can use to see if their courses meet our standards for fleximode
courseware. At the moment it's a manual process to tick the boxes. We
met with Michael Sankey from LTSU this week, and it's pretty clear that
Schematron could play a part in automating lots of the
checklist.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-style:normal; "><span class="T3">As part of our
ongoing exploration of how we might create an automatic or
semi-automatic </span></span><strong><span>system for inferring structure in
documents</span></strong><span style="font-style:normal; "><span class="T3">
Ian Barnes has pointed out that Schematron might play a role there too.
</span></span></p>
<p>Ian's insight was <span style="font-style:normal; "><span
class="T3">prompted by a recent post of Rick Jelliffe's about a project
to add annotations to a corpus of (presumably) word documents in the the
OOXML zip package format:</span></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The brief was for an organization with a large number of documents
from multiple sources, but with each source supposed to use
stylesheets. The idea was to make a rules base that would distinguish
all the different ways that a few structures (titles, table of
contents, potentially citations, etc) were represented. This would
allow classification of documents according to the structures found,
the discovery of outliers and exceptions (e.g. incorrectly marked up
documents, or where additional rules were needed), and automated
annotation back to the original documents.</p>
<p><a href="http://news.oreilly.com/2008/08/a-standardsbased-expert-system.html">http://news.oreilly.com/2008/08/a-standardsbased-expert-system.html</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'll come back to Ian's structure guesser (or as I like to call it the
structure sniffer) in another post and talk here about the possibilities
for adding validation or <strong>dashboard</strong> services for courseware written
using ICE, via Schematron.</p>
<p>Rick's idea of Schematron rules that can reach inside Zip files would be
perfect for the USQ courseware context as our content is in Open
Document Format files (actually some of it is Word docs but we convert
it to ODF as part of the process). We could translate a lot of the
checkboxes in the <em>USQ course writing guide</em> into Schematron rules to do
things like check that there is a an acknowledgements section in the
course introduction. Not only could the system report issues, it could
open up the documents in question for you and take you to the trouble
spots and insert comments in the documents.</p>
<p>Not everything needs to be seen as a validation issue though, just some
reporting would be useful to create a kind of dashboard for courseware.
<span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>Module 4 contains no
activities<span class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> might a worthwhile thing
to report along with word counts for various modules and how many
citations there are, etc.</p>
<p>Another place we could use Schematron to report on course structure
would be in the course organizer, which is part of the IMS package
manifest file in every ICE course. An organizer is a kind of table of
contents for the course, and it is used to generate the navigation.
Schematron could easily be used to validate things such as <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>There must be a <em>Study schedule</em><span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>, and check things like whether the links
to study modules have names that are not just like <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>Module 1<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> but convey a bit more about what's in
the module.</p>
<p>A few years ago Ron Ward and I were involved in a project that used
Schematron. There we used it to validate metadata for documents as they
were uploaded into a content management system <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> Schematron would look for patterns in
the metadata and complain when it was wrong. The complaint took the form
of an HTML form that the user could fill-out to fix the metadata to the
Schematron system's satisfaction. The Schematron rules worked well to
create a true declaratively specified interface, but our implementation
was a bit inflexible, like my attitude at the time, so usability
suffered. Lesson learnt, I hope.</p>
<p>I think that <strong>presenting this as a dashboard</strong> that lets you know what
your course is like will be better than presenting it as <em>validation</em>
which has connotations of centralized control, something that doesn't
always go down well in a university, even when we do have agreed
standards to maintain.</p>
<p>It will be a little while before we get to implementing this I just
wanted to record our current thinking.</p>

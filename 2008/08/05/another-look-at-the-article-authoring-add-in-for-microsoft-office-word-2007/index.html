<p>The <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=09c55527-0759-4d6d-ae02-51e90131997e">Article Authoring Add-in for
Microsoft Office Word
2007</a><span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> (AAAiMOW<a href="#ftn0"><span
style="vertical-align: super;"><span
class="footnote">1</span></span></a>) has been turned loose as a
release candidate. I <a href="http://ptsefton.com/2008/04/24/some-comments-on-the-nlm-xml-plugin-for-word-2007.htm">looked at an earlier version of this a while a
ago</a>.</p>
<p>The name of the thing doesn't let on that it is targeting just one
version of what an article looks like, in the form of the <a href="../%EF%BB%BFhttp://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/publishing/tag-library/2.2/">NLM
schema</a>
I'm not sure if that reflects confidence that the NLM schema is generic
enough to cope with all articles or anticipates a future version which
can support multiple formats.</p>
<p>I had a lot of questions in my previous post <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> most of which I think are not yet
answered, although Pablo Fernicola did drop by my blog and shed light on
some of the issues.</p>
<p>This time, with a fresh virtual installation of Windows XP running under
VirtualBox on OS X the plugin worked a bit better for me so I could see
it in full flight. I still have some serious concerns about this add-in
thing and what it might mean for organizations.</p>
<p>I was going to make a few quick comments about usability, preservation
and lock-in but this post kept growing, I emailed Jon Udell for his take
and did a few tests, and it's ended up well on the way to 2000 words.</p>
<p>[Update : (Minor edits and fixes)</p>
<p>I should point out that while this post is quite picky I'm glad to see
this work going on in Microsoft and I'd love to see how it works out.</p>
<p>Look, if you're not concerned about using an application which is only
for Word 2007 on Windows XP or Vista to create articles which you don't
need to re-use or archive then most of what I've got to say here is
irrelevant.]</p>
<h1><span id="id1"></span><!--id1--></a>Usability?</h1>
<p>I can't find any reports of how this plugin works in real life. Has
anyone tried it? Are you all under NDAs?</p>
<p>I'm concerned about the way that you can add NLM structural elements all
over the place, and nested inside each other in bizarre ways, but then
you can't save to the new proprietary .nlmx format because of validation
errors.</p>
<p>It would be pretty easy to show how you can create invalid structures
using this plugin but I don't really think that's a useful stunt to pull
<span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> what I want to see is what
<strong>real</strong> problems, or lack of them people have with the structural
stuff.</p>
<p>Me, I found it a bit weird but as I said I didn't try to write an
article with it.</p>
<p>There's one interface device that I really like. Each 'section' element
gets a little handle above it so you can drag the whole thing around:</p>
<p><span
style="display: block"><a name="graphics1"></a><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/m11c0c37s248x871.jpg" alt="graphics1" /></span>It
would be really nice if this applied to the document outline as well as
part of the normal Word interface not just to the special embedded XML
sections. I could just style a bit of content as <code>Heading 2</code>, which is
part of the document outline structure, and be able to drag around the
whole of that implied section. Word already does something very like
this if you use the Outline view. Of course, dragging sections in an NLM
document doesn't make sense as they're supposed to be in a particular
order, but I don't imagine most people would drag the high-level
sections. (There's some kind of complex process for dealing with section
ordering or editors, I think).</p>
<p>I'm not sure if I get why the embedded XML is any better than just
recognizing that the text 'Abstract' in <code>Heading 2</code> style is a the start
of the Abstract section. Or you could define sub-classes of heading if
you really wanted to such as <code>Heading 2 - Abstract</code>.</p>
<p>You could still have a toolbar like this so that people can drop in
sections where they want them:</p>
<h1><span id="id2"></span><!--id2--></a><span style="display: block"><a name="graphics2"></a><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/m43505a27s552x1201.jpg" alt="graphics2" /></span>Lock in</h1>
<p>This add-in represents a new opportunity for Microsoft to lock users in
to Word, having just moved on from the proprietary .doc format. This is
not just a matter of trying to sell more copies of Microsoft Office it's
about encouraging users to create documents that only work with a
particular version of Office.</p>
<p>We have just been through a great long debate about standardizing word
processing formats. Microsoft got their way and had their OOXML format
accepted as an ISO Standard (<a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/pressrelease.htm?refid=Ref1123">ISO/IEC DIS
29500</a>). The
benefit is supposed to be that when you write a word processing document
it can be managed and edited in more than one application but I have
always been very dubious about how this fits with the way you can embed
arbitrary foreign XML in Word documents. By contrast the Open Document
Format approach is an <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/GullFOSS/entry/new_extensible_metadata_support_with">RDF based extension
mechanism</a>
which seems a lot cleaner.</p>
<p>I tried out some simple interop with an AAAiMOW document.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Word 2008 on OS X can open it, and you can edit the document at
least a little bit, apparently without breaking it, but anything you
add doesn't have the magic embedded XML. It round tripped without
error but I assume you could break some of the XML.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NeoOffice Writer on the Mac can open the .docx file and you can
edit, but if you save it and re-open in Word then you get an error .
The good news was that Word 2007 was apparently able to rescue the
content but the bad news was that embedded XML went AWOL.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>At the moment I would not have any confidence that anything except Word
2007 can deal with documents created with the add-in, which is as
advertised. Of course, if that's what your team of scientists is using
then no problem, provided you think about how you will preserve the
outputs (see below).</p>
<p>That quick interop test was using the new .docx format which is <strong>not</strong>
the same as <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/pressrelease.htm?refid=Ref1123">ISO/IEC DIS
29500</a>, which
won't be available as a Word format until the next version.</p>
<p>One of the features of the AAAiMOW is a new file format. Yes. A new
non-standard file format which is a misbegotten mashup of OOXML and NLM.
I'm not sure how this is different from the way the content is embedded
in the .docx file. From the readme file:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Both the article contents and metadata authored through the add-in are
stored using XML, as part of a single file, using the Open XML format
for the content and the NLM tagset for the metadata. Content which
does not have an equivalent in Word, or extends existing Word
elements, is stored as custom XML elements within the Open XML data
stream. When a file is saved in the NLM format, the resulting XML file
is stored within a nlmx file, using the same Open Packaging
Conventions used by docx files, providing a single file which can
package all related content (such as images) and supports
extensibility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, the next service pack for Word 2007 will add support for the
Open Document Format (ODF) as a native file format. I'm assuming the
plugin won't work with ODF. (Pablo, am I wrong?)</p>
<p>There's some very alarming use of the passive voice in the documentation
too, a classic computer industry trick. Say it <strong>can</strong> be done without
mentioning who's going to do it and how much it's going to cost.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Based on the use of Open Packaging Conventions, the Open XML format,
and the NLM tagset, tools can be built to access any part of the file,
content or metadata, and extract, validate, or add information to the
file, as part of the publishing workflow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>Can be built?<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> Please. We have one format mixed in to
another format using a user interface that is only accessible from an
expensive proprietary application. I'm sure I could write a script to
pull the NLM bits out of the Open XML but for each new kind of embedded
XML I would have to rewrite my code and test that it works with the user
interface code that has been added to Word <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> in this case it involves dealing with
some special attributes to re-order sections (I think) <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> doesn't look easy or pleasant to me.</p>
<p>[Update <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> to be clear there is no
way that I can see for an author to export he NLM XML format only. I'm
assuming that must be something that happens using a different tool.]</p>
<p>And it is worth remembering that this plugin is not accessible to the
majority even of Windows users. For example here at USQ Word 2007 has
not been rolled out yet<a href="#ftn1"><span style="vertical-align: super;"><span
class="footnote">2</span></span></a>. And the plugin is not
available at all on platforms other than Windows. That's not what I
hoped the new standards-wielding Microsoft was on about.</p>
<h1><span id="id3"></span><!--id3--></a>Preservation</h1>
<p>There are going to be serious issues with preservation. What are
archivists supposed to do with bastard mashed-up formats like this which
depend on a particular package to make sense of them?</p>
<p>It is true that for documents that make it to publication in the NLM XML
format this should not be an issue: the resulting XML should be perfect
for archiving. But I can see that a lot of things that are of value
might not make it through to XML. What about archived author's
manuscripts which are one of the backbones of Open Access? What about
the original editable files for images drawn using Microsoft Office
tools, which are embedded in the source file?</p>
<p>Think about what would happen if this approach became common for
different XML formats <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> there could
be a proliferation of non-standard polluted Word document to deal with
in repositories.</p>
<p>This add-in represents the Microsoft business model in action. See Brian
Jones' response to my probing on the issue of how this bastard mashup
stuff is supposed to work. I quoted
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/brian_jones/archive/2005/07/08/436973.aspx#452483">this</a>
last time, but it's worth reminding ourselves that this is what
Microsoft is about, never mind the standards:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a huge market that exists today for custom Office solutions.
People customize the Office applications in all kinds of ways to try
to get more out of their documents. By adding the support for custom
defined schemas, we made it much easier to build semi-structured
solutions on top of Word. Rather than rely on hacks with styles or
bookmarks, folks could create a simple schema and add some XML tags
into their existing document solutions.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/brian_jones/archive/2005/07/08/436973.aspx#452483">http://blogs.msdn.com/brian_jones/archive/2005/07/08/436973.aspx#452483</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brian Jones calls using styles to carry semantics 'a hack' and yet
embedding foreign XML in a Word document and hand-crafting a user
interface to deal with the resulting mishmash of tags is somehow not a
hack? I agree that styles and bookmarks (and tables <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> we use them a lot) are somewhat limited
carriers for microformats but the XML embedding thing has always looked
like a trap to me <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> too expensive to
set up and maintain and too much embedded in the Windows world. As I
mentioned above, I think the new extension mechanism for ODF may be a
better compromise <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> maybe we'll see
that in the ODF support in the service pack release in 2009.</p>
<h1><span id="id4"></span><!--id4--></a>An alternative</h1>
<p>There's an alternative approach which is to use features that are common
to word processors in general and which are expressed in the underlying
file formats directly, which I wrote about in my last post. There would
be some interesting challenges in finding interoperable ways to embed
all the 'special' items that are allowed <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> some of these are already supported in
our ICE templates but not quite with the same structural rigor as in
this the add-in.</p>
<p><span
style="display: block"><a name="graphics3"></a><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/m24c568es552x731.jpg" alt="graphics3" /></span></p>
<p>Chris Rusbridge from the <a href="http://ptsefton.com/2008/04/24/some-comments-on-the-nlm-xml-plugin-for-word-2007.htm#comment-1542">lamented in the comments of my last
post</a>
that we don't do NLM export from <a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/">ICE</a> <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> but I reckon we could produce NLM XML
from ICE documents with no more subsequent work required of editors than
you would get using the AAAiMOW (I'm guessing <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> we have no data about how well it [the
add-in] works and I have yet to work through the section of the
documentation for editors).</p>
<p>The readme tells us that styles don't work (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Custom XML elements are used to represent other abstractions that
exist in the NLM tagset, but that are not found in Word, and to do so
in a manner that can be presented to the author for editing in a
robust way <strong>(unlike the use of custom styles, which was one of the
ways to try to solve this problem in earlier versions of Word, and was
not very reliable).</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have no doubt that there are lots of terrible style based systems out
there, but we have worked hard on making styles usable, interoperable
and easy to apply and providing robust rapid-feedback document
conversion.</p>
<p>(Maybe both of us are wrong <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> MJ
Suhonos at <a href="http://pkp.sfu.ca/lemon8">PKP thinks that you can create
XML</a> without using either styles or embedded
XML by using document formatting to infer structure.)</p>
<p>Would anyone care to fund a small project to see if we can use ICE to
produce similar overall results (in terms of overall ROI) to the AAAiMOW
but in a cross-platform solution? Microsoft? Anyone in the UK with
access to JISC funds? A publisher?</p>

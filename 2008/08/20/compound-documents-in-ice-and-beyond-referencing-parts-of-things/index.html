Compound documents in ICE and beyond; referencing parts of things

<p>Ben O'Steen has put up <a href="http://oxfordrepo.blogspot.com/2008/08/four-rules-of-web-and-compound.html">some
thoughts</a>
on what he refers to as 'compound' documents and how to store them in
repositories and allow for referencing of parts of a document, such as a
table, a graph or even a paragraph.</p>
<p>Why did I add the scare quotes to <em>compound</em>?</p>
<p>While to a computer scientist a research paper with its graphs and
tables and paragraphs might be compound, I suspect most authors tend to
think of a research article as a single entity. Until we start giving
them access to services that make it clear that it's not monolithic,
that is.</p>
<p>As background, Ben gives four rules:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that the four rules of the web (well, of Linked Data technically)
are in essence:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>give everything a name,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make that name a URL ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>which results in data about that thing,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and have it link to other related things.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I strongly believe that applying this to the individual components of
a document is a very good and useful thing.</p>
<p><a href="http://oxfordrepo.blogspot.com/2008/08/four-rules-of-web-and-compound.html">http://oxfordrepo.blogspot.com/2008/08/four-rules-of-web-and-compound.html</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Agreed.</p>
<p>He goes on to talk about repository services will have to have an
explicit contract with authors that lets them know that their document
is not just going to be presented in one monolithic format, by default
the dreaded PDF.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One thing first, we have to get over the legal issue of just storing
and presenting a bitwise perfect copy of what an author gives us. We
need to let author's know that we may present alternate versions,
based on a user's demands. This actually needs to be the case for
preservation and the repository needs to make it part of their
submission policy to allow for format migrations, accessibility
requirements and so on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we get authors using a system like <a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/">ICE</a> then
this will be:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Easier for them to understand because they can see multiple formats
generated automatically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Easy to implement, by hooking up ICE (or similar) directly to
repositories. Just this week Oliver Lucido has ICE putting content
straight in to ePrints via OAI-ORE <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> that's automatically adding an HTML
and PDF view.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So far with ICE we have done a number of demo hook-ups to repository
software. It's now time to turn this on for real <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> we will get ICE hooked up to USQ ePrints
ASAP. This will mean that all the images in a document will
automatically become referenceable. That is, in Ben's terms each image
will have a name which is a URL.</p>
<p>Going beyond images, we have already done some work in ICE on making
paragraphs referenceable, not in a repository context but in an
editorial workflow. For example, this blog post has been created in ICE.
Here's a screenshot of an earlier version of this very paragraph in the
HTML view.</p>
<p><span
style="display: block"><a name="graphics1"></a><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/7d9da2b3s554x54.jpg" alt="graphics1"></span>See
the blue pilcrow? That's the symbol that <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/05/31/PurpleAgain">Tim Bray uses on his
blog</a> to
make each paragraph referenceable. Go and have a look, you can link to
or refer to any part of any post on his site. In ICE, however, the
plicrow is not for referencing elsewhere, it's for commenting.</p>
<p>See the spelling error? I can annotate the document:</p>
<p><a name="graphics2"></a><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/m5b3fb20as554x140.jpg" alt="graphics2"></p>
<p>Now, if I fix the paragraph, the comment will disappear from the main
body of the text but the old, broken version of the paragraph is kept
<span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> it shows at the bottom of the page
until I delete it.</p>
<p>So, ICE already knows how to identify any paragraph and has some
rudimentary version control for document parts<span class="T3"><a href="#ftn0"><span
style="vertical-align: super;"><span
class="footnote">*</span></span></a></span>, but the context
matters.In an authoring context we needed something that was not too
sensitive to document order, and it had to work with documents created
by word processors, so we can't just assign unique IDs to paragraphs the
way Tim Bray can in his bespoke workflow. But when it comes to pushing
(or pulling) a document into a repository, where there is some
expectation that it will not change, there is no reason that we can't
mint IDs for parts of a document, and figure out a way to make them
obviously citable along the lines of Tim's purple pilcrows.</p>
<p>Coming back to Ben's post. Why not make the HTML view the 'normal' way
to look at an article where possible? This would mean that you don't
have to store a document in fragments, merely label the parts of the
HTML. I guess I'm agreeing with Ben's tentative suggestion that HTML
might be a good format to hang this on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have yet to settle on basing it on the content XML format inside the
OpenDocument format, or on something very lightweight, using HTML
elements, which would have a double benefit of being able to be sent
directly to a browser to 'recreate' the document roughly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Forget 'roughly', at least for documents created with an HTML-ready
workflow like ICE. It would even less rough if authors choose something
like the <a href="http://ptsefton.com/2008/08/05/another-look-at-the-article-authoring-add-in-for-microsoft-office-word-2007.htm">Article Authoring Add-in for Microsoft Office Word
2007</a>.
But Ben's right; for documents that are deposited in PDF or in
unstructured word processing formats then HTML is going to be rough.</p>
<p>Just how we might handle the user interface issues for exposing names
(URLs) of the parts of a document is unresolved, but we'll give it a go
here at USQ with our ICE and ePrints systems.</p>

<p>I have been very slow getting to this, and I missed catching up with
Microsoft people at <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/or08">Open Repositories
2008</a> but I wanted to make a couple of
comments on the new Microsoft Word 2007 plugin for authoring journal
articles in the (USA) National Library of Medicine XML format. I saw
this originally via <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/brian_jones">Brian Jones</a> at
Microsoft.</p>
<p>I have several questions about this plugin. Actually, they're concerns
more than questions.</p>
<p>I will look briefly at the plugin here and then try to put it in
historical context and then as always I will suggest another approach
using the <a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/">Integrated Content Environment</a>,
which we're probably not going to have time to try out in the short
term.</p>
<p>Microsoft's Pablo Fernicola says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The goal is to simplify several activities in the publishing workflow,
from authoring to publishing and archiving, with this last step
including conversion to the XML format from the National Library of
Medicine. The current process of getting an article from the authors
to a journal (increasingly electronic only) is a bit complicated and
many times lossy, especially in relation to the metadata related to
the article, we hope that the add-in will help simplify and improve
the process.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/exscientia/archive/2008/03/20/Technology-Preview-Launch.aspx">http://blogs.msdn.com/exscientia/archive/2008/03/20/Technology-Preview-Launch.aspx</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/exscientia/archive/2008/03/25/short-video-clip-on-the-add-in.aspx">video</a>.
Which shows Pablo creating a new document from a template and adding
some stuff to it. After watching the demo I downloaded the software and
tried it out. You need Word 2007 so that meant installing Windows XP in
a virtual machine on the MacBook, along with Office and other stuff. I'm
pretty sure this plugin will never be coming to Mac Word or to Linux
which means cutting out a growing number of authors.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if the Add-In is really working for me. I get a template
but I can't find any new user interface items or figure out how to add
metadata. But then I can't find anything in that new Word 2007 interface
because I have not invested time in learning it.</p>
<p>A few of the questions that occur to me:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Why does the demo show putting a table in the abstract? I checked,
and it is allowed by the DTD, but I don't think that articles
usually have tables in the abstract. Also, I don't think the demo
shows valid NLM XML; shouldn't the table be wrapped in a section
element?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What's with the 'lets go ahead and make some stuff bold and
underlined' in the demo <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> are
there some more semantic elements that could be used instead?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How come I can pick up the introduction and move it around my
document? If I can do that what's the difference from a style-based
system where the structure is implied by styles? Also, I'm a bit
confused by the empty paragraphs between sections. Are they meant to
be there? What if I type in one of them?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How would preservation people rate the resulting Word document? It's
a kind of mishmash of two standards and as far as I can see. So to
make sense of it you're going to need lots of user interface code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What's the development cost on an effort like this versus the likely
saving in time at the journal?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are there any examples of similar efforts that work with decent ROI?
Has anyone yet made a usable DocBook editor in Word? What about
XHTML? TEI? I suspect the answer remains no, just as it was back in
2005 when Word 2003 had been around for a while. This suggests to me
that Word is still not a good platform on which to build an XML
editor. Happy to be proved wrong, though.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do I repurpose my article for other journals when it's rejected?
How about copy and paste with my other documents?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How are the pilot authors liking it?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How much support do we expect authors to need?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, lets go back in history a bit.</p>
<p>In 2005 I corresponded with Brian Jones of Microsoft's Word team about
this kind of use for Word as an XML editor. I questioned just how the
feature in MS Word that lets you mix in foreign XML schemas is supposed
to work. Back then I called it <a href="http://ptsefton.com/blog/2005/08/13/more_on_microsoft_word_vs_xml_schemas/">the bizarre feature that lets you mix
schema-controlled XML content in amongst Word's own
structure</a>.
See Brian's <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/brian_jones/archive/2005/07/08/436973.aspx#452483">reply in his
comments</a>
with emphasis by me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The first point is that our main scenarios weren't about turning
Word into an XML editor.</strong> As you can imagine, we have a fairly large
user base, and investing the amount of resources we did into our XML
support just to target the XML editor market wouldn't have made a lot
of sense. The XML support is really for a much broader set of
scenarios.</p>
<p>There is a huge market that exists today for custom Office solutions.
People customize the Office applications in all kinds of ways to try
to get more out of their documents. By adding the support for custom
defined schemas, we made it much easier to <strong>build semi-structured
solutions on top of Word</strong>. Rather than rely on hacks with styles or
bookmarks, folks could create a simple schema and add some XML tags
into their existing document solutions.</p>
<p>We provide a fairly rich object model on top of the XML functionality,
as well as the ability to save an entire Word document as XML (using
the WordprocessingML schema). These tools make it much easier to build
document generation and consumption solutions, as well as more
reliable add-ins that act on the document while it's being authored.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/brian_jones/archive/2005/07/08/436973.aspx#452483">http://blogs.msdn.com/brian_jones/archive/2005/07/08/436973.aspx#452483</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So Word's XML schema integration is going to work at the level of small
structural chunks like metadata but is not likely to work for schemas
with several hundred elements in them.</p>
<p>I keep an eye out and I have not been able to find a single example of a
full DocBook, or XHTML, or TEI or whatever application that's built on
Word 2003+.</p>
<p>Going back further in history, who remembers
<a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/SeyboldReport/ip020905.html">BladeRunner</a>?
Never even made it to market.</p>
<p>What about <a href="http://xml.coverpages.org/authorTech.html">Microsoft's own SGML
author</a>, terrible thing, more
than ten years dead.</p>
<p>With my limited imagination I can't see how you can mash-together a
generic word processor and an XML editor and get something that's going
to be widely usable. Adobe Framemaker had a sort-of XML editing mode but
it was not the sort of thing I'd expect ordinary authors to deal with,
and setting up new documents required us to hire a consultant for a week
just to get started. WordPerfect had a structured mode, but the way I
remember it, it was very much segmented off from the ordinary word
processing part of the application.</p>
<p>And even if this approach did work it represents a new kind of vendor
lockin. Instead of having a standard format for your document as with
OOXML or the NLM XML format you have an unholy mishmash of the two which
requires custom code for users to edit it. The custom code runs in Word,
so you have just lost one of the main benefits you're supposed to get
from a standard format which is the ability to switch editing
applications. Yeah, I know, the only thing on the planet that can edit
full OOXML is MS Office and that's not likely to change in the n ear
future, but if you take care about which features you use then you can
get reasonable interop between word processors which you will loose with
this kind of mishmash.</p>
<p>In my opinion one of the great things about word processors, and
particularly Word, is that they allow you to manage structure by
implying it. Word has a great outliner which lets you structure your
work and move stuff around, while still allowing lots of freedom to copy
and paste. It's simply not true what a lot of XML people say, that word
processing files are 'flat'. Out of the box using headings, your Word
document has an outline. Just because it's not serialised into nested
XML doesn't mean the structure doesn't exist.</p>
<p>You can turn something into a heading by adding a style and turn it back
into ordinary text the same way. That kind of operation can require some
serious gymnastics if you try it with a validating XML editor, cos a
heading is not just a heading it's typically a magic element that's part
of a bigger element which is part of an explicit hierarchy. Me I prefer
working with implicit hierarchy and WYSIOOTMFYG (What You See Is One Of
The Many Formats You Get) which is why I choose a word processor over an
XML editor or a text editor even though I'm pretty sure I'm smart enough
to use Emacs + DocBook if I wanted to.</p>
<p>I promised an alternative suggestion. So here goes.</p>
<p>Why not work out a generic set of word processor styles and microformats
that can be used for academic authoring, which can be assembled into
downloadable templates with the right look and feel for various journals
and conferences, so authors need only learn one system of styles. Write
some software that can render these documents as high-quality HTML, and
PDF using the word processor itself, for low-end publishing. For
higher-end work transform from XHTML to the XML DTD of your choice or
just pump the content into Adobe InDesign or similar and forget the DTD
<a href="http://ptsefton.com/blog/2004/06/18/xhtmlasuniveraldocumentformat/">like I said nearly four years ago in support of Tim
Bray</a>.</p>
<p>As an author, I'd prefer to have a generic way to write structured
documents that I can use for all my writing. I'd really dread being
expected to learn several variations on the XML embedded in Word theme.
Or adapt to several different templates all with a different name for a
block-quote, or a bullet list, or deal with templates that don't use
styles at all, which is pretty much the way things are at the moment for
academic authors.</p>
<p>Actually, the <a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/">ICE</a> team have done lots of work
on this already, including a proof-of concept we knocked up in
FrameMaker that used its structured mode to render XHTML back when most
of us worked for the ill-fated NextEd.</p>
<p>We're working with a research group at <a href="http://www.usq.edu.au/">USQ</a> to
test out these very ideas <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> they
will work in ICE, either using MS Word or OpenOffice.org Writer, and
we'll try to help out by providing import and export from the various
word templates that journals provide.</p>
<p>I hope we can find the time and resources to explore this idea with the
National Library of Medicine XML format as well <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> it would be nice to contrast the
development cost and usability of a cross-platform ICE-based authoring
environment versus the work that Microsoft has been doing on their Word
2007 solution.</p>
<p>Another nice to have would be a Word version of our word-processor to
XHTML code. At the moment we use OpenOffice.org as a conversion-hub, but
it has some limits to its Word support. A native implementation would be
better for Windows users who want to use Word. At the moment we
recommend serious ICE users use OpenOffice.org or a derivative but we do
support Word.</p>

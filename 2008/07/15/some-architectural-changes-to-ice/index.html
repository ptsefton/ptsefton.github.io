Some architectural changes to ICE

<p>This post is a look at some architectural changes we're looking at for
the <a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/">ICE</a>system, as we hit the limits of what we
could squeeze out of the old architecture.</p>
<p>Ron Ward has just finished a major rewrite of lots of the application,
designed to make it work on a central web server with multiple users, in
addition to the 'classic' mode where everyone has their own ICE server
running on their own computer. He's spent the last few months trying to
get Subversion to do things it was clearly never meant to do.</p>
<p>ICE uses Subversion as a back-end version controlled data store. In the
ICE classic mode multiple users work with checked-out working copies of
a repository and hit 'Sync' to send their changes back to the server and
get updates. Behind the Sync button is a fiendishly complicated bit of
code that gets updates from the server, detects conflicts, tries to
resolve them as gracefully as possible and provide a usable web GUI for
the authors.</p>
<p><span

1: ICE Classic mode: each user has their own ICE application which looks
after their working copy, ICE uses the Subversion protocol to
synchronize everyone's work</p>
<p>Ron's big rewrite has lots of unit tests based on all the trouble we've
come across (mis)using Subversion for the last couple of years so we're
happy that it will be robust when running in classic mode.</p>
<p>But the new server version is a problem. If you have multiple users
trying to access the same working copy all at once, then Subversion gets
in the way <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> it starts locking files
all over the place for example. One simple solution is just to put out a
server version that doesn't allow distributed editing like ICE classic
does, but our courseware authors really need the ability to manage large
volumes of stuff on their own PCs as some courses are pretty big, with a
lot of digital assets, while we want to have web access for reviewers
and casual contributors to the same courses via a central web service.</p>
<p>So we're looking at a new server mode where ICE still has a working copy
but it knows that it is the only user-agent who has it checked out so it
doesn't need to do updates, it can just do commits. If all you want is a
web based content management system then this will be all you need to
install and it should run pretty well.</p>
<p>If you are following this technobabble then you'll be asking <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>but how does that help the ICE classic
users work when there's an ICE server? That would mean that changes made
on an ICE client would never make it to the server!<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span></p>
<p><span

2: ICE Server mode: No subversion updates required as it is the only
user-agent committing changes to the working copy</p>
<p>That's the tricky part <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> we need to
create a new mode of operation for ICE where people want the benefits of
the server version AND the classic distributed mode of working. In this
mode the ICE application will work in a new 'client' mode. It will only
ever get updates from the central repository. Any additions or changes
won't be fed back to subversion directly <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> the ICE client will post them just like
any other user into the ICE server.
This will require some more coding, but probably not as much as it would
have taken to get the ICE server working any other way <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> and it opens up the possibility that we
can replace Subversion and use a simpler version control system,
possibly of our own devising in future. So a future model might have the
ICE server acting not only as interface for humans but for other ICE
systems.</p>

3: ICE Client mode: Users can update their local repository but all
changes go via the ICE server. We will automate this so it is seamless
for users.</p>
<p>Having made this architectural decision we can press on with testing the
ICE server straight away, even without making any changes to the client
version. Here's the plan which we will roll through over then few weeks:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>For the repositories which currently allow both server and classic
access we turn off the ability for users to commit using ICE
classic. If people want to check out their own copy of the content
they can, as long as they post their changes back in through the
server version manually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We modify the ICE server so it now assumes that it has THE working
copy and only commits changes <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span>
never updates <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> this will mean
we can support multiple users with no dramas (that's the plan
anyway).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will make a new client mode for ICE which automate the process of
detecting changes and posting them from the client version of ICE
through the 'front door' of the server version pretty much like any
other user. Updates will happen as they do now, from the subversion
repository.</p>

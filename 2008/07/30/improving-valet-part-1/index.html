<p>This week the ARROW community is having get together for developers to
work on the VALET repository ingest tool. This is probably of little
interest if you're not a repository person (or rat) but if you are then
this may be of interest whether you are associated with the VITAL /
Fedora world or not.</p>
<p>VALET is a deposit tool designed to allow self-deposit of electronic
stuff into a <a href="http://fedora-commons.org/">Fedora</a> repository,
specifically one running <a href="http://www.vtls.com/vital">VTLS VITAL</a>. The
bit about VITAL is crucially important <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> Fedora is an underlying storage layer, a
kind of database, and different software will use it in different ways.
VITAL has some tricks for storing datastreams derived form other assets,
such as full-text extracted from PDF that other software like
<a href="http://fez.sourceforge.net/">Fez</a> would not understand.</p>
<p>VALET comes in two versions.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There's an open source one <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>Valet for ETDs<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> which is set up initially just to
deal with Electronic Theses and Dissertations (ETDs). It's available
from the VTLS website or from Google Code (last week the one at the
VTLS site was out of date, and the package for download from Google
Code was slightly less out of date but I think they might be
up-to-date now).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The other version is mostly the same but is not free. It is
important to make the distinction because if you customize the
non-free version then you would have to ask VTLS for permission to
redistribute it, possibly even within your own institution. I am not
a lawyer (although I have a 10 year old who is threatening to become
one) but I would be very cautious about changing a file that says
<span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>(c) &lt;Some Corporation&gt; All
rights reserved<span class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> (Her other
potential career is being a computer programmer <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> might be a good idea to do both so
she can be rich <strong>and</strong> happy).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So the outcome of the workshop will be to get a version of the
open-source VALET with the best of the modifications that people have
made at their sites, with maybe some new features.</p>
<p>One much requested feature for VALET (and for VITAL too) is to be able
to edit submissions that have already been approved and pushed through
VALET workflow into the repository. It's kind-of surprising that VALET
doesn't do this already but it doesn't.</p>
<p>I had an idea about how this might work last week, and Tim McCallum has
implemented the first part of it already. To explain it we have to go
into a little bit of detail about how VALET works. VALET takes a very
simple approach to workflow, of which I for one approve. In simple
terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An administrator defines a workflow with a set number of steps and
says who can approve a submission at each step.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An administrator defines a web form, based on the example(s) shipped
by VTLS to collect the metadata required for a submission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At each stage the software simply serializes the information in the
form into XML and saves it on disk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each new stage the program picks up the information from disk
and puts the values back into the form.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the final stage the program runs XSLT stylesheets (supplied by
the administrator) to transform the serialized form data into the
'proper' metadata for the repository.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What Tim has done is simply to create an additional data stream
containing the form data along with the other data streams when an item
is approved. This means that it will be there alongside the repository
item and all the other metadata streams. I think this will be really
useful in solving some of the ongoing issues people are having with
their repositories. For example, you might want to capture author email
addresses but there is no sensible place to put them in a MODS
datastream.</p>
<p>I know, some of you are thinking about standards <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> how can I save my important data in a
non-standard format? To which I say, better to save your data in a form
which is not standard and not pretending to be standard, than to rush
into inventing a new standard which only you support. Is there a
standard out there that captures all the data you want to save? Then use
it. If not, capture the data now and work with the community to define
the standard you need.</p>
<p>I'm not the only one who had this idea. I found out that Vicki Picasso
from Newcastle also thought it would be good to capture the VALET form.</p>
<p>This approach is actually very similar to what you do in ePrints <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> you can define any old metadata you want
(as long as it's flat name-value pairs) and map it to Dublin Core as you
see fit for dissemination purposes.</p>
<p>In VITAL, and in our <a href="http://ptsefton.com/2008/06/27/tim-mccallum-shows-off-sun-of-fedora.htm">Sun Of
Fedora</a>
repository portal project you can index any XML datastream you like. So
if you want to collect HERDC categories (that's to do with reporting
research publications to the Australian Government <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> very important stuff) then you can,
without having to jam them into a metadata schema that was not designed
to take them.</p>
<p>Next steps in the work Tim started:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Work out how to search for and retrieve an item to be re-edited,
putting it back in the workflow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work out how to create the formdata from existing items that did not
get put in the repository. We already have some experience with
generating VALET form data based on a very cool idea by Simon
McMillan of UNE who can't make it to the workshop. Get well Simon!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(I put it to my daughter that she could be a programmer and a lawyer and
that would make her rich and happy. She said of course being a lawyer
would make her rich and happy. I asked what would being a programmer
make her? A nerd, apparently.)</p>

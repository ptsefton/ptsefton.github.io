A [presentation for the ARROW Repository
day](http://arrow.edu.au/news/abstracts.php#What) 2008-12-14
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Open Archives Initiative Object Reuse and Exchange
(OAI-ORE), is an important new protocol for representing compound
objects, or aggregations, in a web environment. The system is generating
a lot of development activity in the repository community some of which
will be reported in this presentation.</p>
<p>One of the main contributions of ORE will be a way to describe an item
that is made up of several parts. The classic example is an HTML
document and its images <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> until the
advent of OAI-ORE there has been no standardized way to draw a line
around such an aggregation. What may seem obvious to a reader has not
been obvious to machines for which the document and its images are
treated as equivalent in status. Likewise ORE will help to define what
is an item in a repository in a way that can help to make items portable
between systems. It will also allow systems to exchange objects that are
made up of multiple parts, such as a thesis with multiple chapters and
data files.</p>
<p>The presentation will include some ORE demonstrations and discussion
<span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> showing some USQ work on how
documents from a content management system can be automatically ingested
into repository systems (we will demo with
<a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/">ICE</a>, <a href="http://eprints.usq.edu.au/">ePrints</a> and
<a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/projects/fascinator/trac/wiki/">The Fascinator</a>),
and how items can be migrated from one repository to another. There will
also be some more speculative discussion of future possibilities and
some examples of other work.</p>
<p>OAI is a conceptually complex system with its own very tightly defined
set of terms and some very refined and nuanced design. It is likely that
for the most part, developers will work with OAI-ORE libraries to get
things done, and for end users and repositarians the system will be
completely transparent in much the same way most of us never need to
look <em>inside</em> an OAI-PMH feed.</p>
<h1><span id="id1"></span><!--id1--></a>1 Introduction <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> Standards</h1>
<p>Before I go on to talk about ORE <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span>
that's Object Reuse and Exchange <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> I
thought I'd talk a little bit about standards in general and then about
some experiences with standards in the Australian repository domain,
particularly in the ARROW community.</p>
<p>I used to work at Standards Australia. They liked to say there <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>The good thing about standards is that
there are so many of them.<span class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> It was a
laugh a minute, at Standards at least when it was in Homebush in the
good old days, before they moved it to the CBD and floated it on the
stock exchange.</p>
<p>Me, I always wanted a little sign in the office that said <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>We have standards to maintain<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>.</p>
<p>Eventually I got sick of wearing a tie and moved to Queensland.</p>
<p>So what's the point of a Standard?</p>
<p>In the software world one thing people worry about is, can I replace
this bit of software with a different one later? Can I shop around for a
database? Even when we're dealing with open standards and open software
he answer is often, <em>well sort of</em>.</p>

|     several different databases.     |                                      |

</div>
</div>
<p>It's not just about components, though. The big thing is
interoperability. Can my systems interoperate with yours now? And will
my digital assets interoperate with <strong>my own</strong> future systems?</p>
<p>The thing that's important about those standard components is their
interfaces. That is, how they fit together.</p>
<p>And how they behave if you move them from one site to another.</p>
<p>I make the point about interop because I want to come back to it later.
You need to think very hard about whether it is worth using a standard
to do something that you can't later reuse.</p>
<h1><span id="id2"></span><!--id2--></a>2 Two examples of standards</h1>
<p>Lets look at two standards that have been used and/or promoted in the
Repository space before going on to look at OAI-ORE; OAI-PMH and XACML.</p>
<h2><span id="id3"></span><!--id3--></a>2.1 OAI-PMH</h2>
<p>The Open Access Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting is a
must-have standard for repositories. It's used for disseminating
repository content to registries and indexes that aggregate content.</p>
<div class="slide">
<h1>OAI-PMH</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Mostly works.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A standard for moving metadata from one place to another.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<hr />
<p>It's just the messenger.</p>
<p>Not all the messages that people send over it are coherent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<hr />
<p>There are ugly bits.</p>
<p>Particularly its use of <a href="http://metalogger.wordpress.com/2008/10/10/are-repositories-set-to-be-left-out-in-the-cold/">non-standard Dublin Core
identifiers</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>OAI-PMH is, basically A Good Thing. That's not to say that it's
painless, though.</p>
<p>The OAI-PMH standard actually clashes with the Dublin Core standard in
at least one place. Neil Godfrey <a href="http://metalogger.wordpress.com/2008/10/10/are-repositories-set-to-be-left-out-in-the-cold/">nails the issue in a blog
post</a>.</p>
<p>But worse than that in practical terms harvesting is a mess. While the
interchange protocol (PMH) more or less works the stuff that people
interchange is very far from being standardized. At the National Library
of Australia's <a href="http://search.arrow.edu.au/">ARROW discovery service</a>
they have a normalization process built into their harvester that
presents a coherent view. This is not the result of standardization,
it's the result of Alison Dellit and the NLA team's hard work in writing
rules that say thing like:</p>
<pre><code>For the USQ repository:

  If type is_equal_to “ADT_Thesis&quot;:

     set type to &quot;australasian digital thesis”
</code></pre>
<p>These rules normalize the chaos that is Australian Institutional
Repositories. This is certainly made easier by a pretty-good level of
standardization in some areas. At least people put the resource type in
the dc:type element!</p>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Don't shoot the messenger (PMH)</h1>
<p>The <a href="http://aust-repos-census.usq.edu.au/the-fascinator/search/default/conference">Australian University Repository
Census</a>
(AUIRC <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> pronounced OIK) uses
OAI-PMH to harvest items from as many Australian Universities as it can.</p>
<p>Compare!</p>

+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2><span id="id4"></span><!--id4--></a>2.2 XACML</h2>
<p>But not all standards have worked out so well. One thing that has
definitely been much more painful for the ARROW community than OAI-PMH
is XACML, the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language. There has been
an expectation that this will be a key standard for repositories but it
so far has not turned out that way.</p>
<p>(Actually, it's not even a markup language! Markup is something that
you'd put in-line in something else, like a bold tag in an HTML page, or
a structural element like chapter in XML.)</p>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Great eXpectations for XACML</h1>
<p>XACML is supposed to let you write role-based policies for items in your
repository. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>Only initiated females from the
Australian Labor Party and mathematicians are allowed to see
this.<span class="spCh spChx201d">”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How was your university going to share access policies for
mathematicians with my university?</p>
<p>See the
<a href="http://www.nmi-edit.org/eduPerson/internet2-mace-dir-eduperson-200806.html">eduPerson</a>
spec. Can you figure it out?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And did we all expect to be interchanging XACML policies. Really?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>I was always vaguely worried about how XACML policies were going to work
but one day I met Kent Fitch who really nailed it. On the subject of
these use cases for XACML where you, an anthropologist want to grant
access to a repository to other anthropologists, he asked <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>What's an anthropologist?<a href="#ftn1"><span
style="vertical-align: super;"><span
class="footnote">1</span></span></a><span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span></p>
<p>This is a very, very good question. Does an academic working in the
education faculty who self-identifies as a visual ehnographer qualify?
What if she's got an honours degree in anthropology? In an access
federation would the archaeologists who make up our anthropology
department count as archaeologists?</p>
<p>Just look at the wide variety of names used to refer to to a thesis in
Australian repositories. Remember this is librarians we're talking about
here (and maybe the research office), if these information professionals
can't agree on what to call something as well defined as a thesis how
will they go labeling archaeologists anthropologists, ethnographers,
linguists and so on in such a way that I can trust the labels enough to
give those people access to research materials in my repository?</p>
<p>But that's not the biggest problem with the unrealistic expectations
heaped on XACML.</p>
<div class="slide">
<h1>What's wrong with XACML for ARROW*?</h1>
<p><a name="Object2"></a><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/m41282af1.gif" alt="Object2" /></p>
<p>Got that? No good for search = no good for &gt; 50% of what you thought
you wanted it for.</p>
<p>*I'm not saying there's anything wrong with XACML in other contexts.
Might be. Might not be.</p>
</div>
<p>The problem is that an XACML policy tells you who has what kind of
access to an item, but if the XACML is not able to be integrated with
the search index then you can't filter search results per-user without
looking at every single item. Very slow, that. But if you don't then you
risk letting on that your repository contains something that you should
not be disclosing, like the name of a chemical which is the subject of a
patent application, or worse the name of a person that you must not
disclose.</p>
<p>(The good news is that a project we've been doing at USQ called <a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/projects/fascinator/trac">The
Fascinator</a> takes an
approach to access control that <strong>is</strong> integrated with search and so far
that seems to be working.)</p>
<p>So as I go on and I tell you about how I think ORE is going to be a very
useful standard for your repository and the services that go around it,
we all need to remember that standards are much less use if there's no
possibility of interoperability. For XACML the possibility that you
could move an access policy from one repository to another is
vanishingly small <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> remember, we all
call a PhD thesis something different. There might be an advantage to
learning just one policy expression language but it's certainly not the
same advantage as you'd get if you could share policies.</p>
<p>And don't forget that the big problem with XACML is that it turns out to
be no good for search. My advice is not to ask for a particular standard
because someone else tells you it's important; look for useful software
but check that it is going to interoperate with other services and with
your own services into the future. Standards do matter.</p>
<h1><span id="id5"></span><!--id5--></a>3 OAI-ORE</h1>
<p>Now the the real topic of this presentation.</p>
<p>Officially:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Open Archives Initiative Object Reuse and Exchange (OAI-ORE) defines
standards for the description and exchange of aggregations of Web
resources. These aggregations, sometimes called compound digital
objects, may combine distributed resources with multiple media types
including text, images, data, and video. The goal of these standards
is to expose the rich content in these aggregations to applications
that support authoring, deposit, exchange, visualization, reuse, and
preservation. Although a motivating use case for the work is the
changing nature of scholarship and scholarly communication, and the
need for cyberinfrastructure to support that scholarship, the intent
of the effort is to develop standards that generalize across all
web-based information including the increasing popular social networks
of <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>web 2.0<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>.</p>

<p>*Shouldn't it be exchange <em>then</em><span style="font-style:normal; "><span
class="T4"> reuse; OER</span></span>?</p>
</div>
<p>Look at my <a href="http://ptsefton.com/">blog</a>. To put content on the blog I
use AtomPub <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> a standard protocol
for pushing web content to a server.</p>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Consider a <a href="http://ptsefton.com/2008/09/19/is-this-thing-working.htm">blog post</a></h1>
<p><span
style="display: block"><a name="graphics4"></a><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/m7c38d25as519x281.jpg" alt="graphics4" /></span>Which
bits of this page are part of the 'post'?</p>
</div>
<p>One of the really dumb things about blogs in general is that to the blog
<em>application</em> an article usually consists of just the HTML part. In
WordPress, for example a post is a bit of HTML and some metadata. If I
want to include a picture it has to go into an uploads directory. To the
reader, it is perfectly reasonable to think of a blog post with a couple
of images as a single document but most blogging software and the ATOM
protocol don't really support this. To further complicate matters a blog
could be laced with advertisements and adorned with web 2.0 widgets that
most of us would not consider part of the content. In the example above
there's an automatically generated map which is actually <strong>not</strong> part of
the content I typed in but which is generated from it.</p>
<p>ORE offers a web-based way to describe an aggregate resource, what I
think of as a post, made up of the HTML part and the images that the
software likes to think of as uploads but which I think of as part of my
document.</p>
<p>Only it doesn't work like that. Not for WordPress. The <a href="http://lackoftalent.org/michael/blog/ore-wordpress-plug-in/#comment-91707">plugin I
installed at my
blog</a>
doesn't treat stuff from the uploads directory as being part of the
post. (But it will, it seems).</p>
<div class="slide">
<h1>The ORE view of a blog post</h1>
<p><a name="Object1"></a><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/331aac20s526x355.jpg" alt="Object1" /></p>
</div>
<p>The ORE tutorial starts off with simple stuff like this, but it quickly
gets fiendishly complicated, and you have to deal with prose which is
obviously very carefully worded but can be quite impenetrable.</p>
<div class="slide">
<h1>More about OAI-ORE</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can decorate the simple ORE graph above with lots and lots of
extra metadata and rich semantics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The aggregation is <em>imaginary</em>. It is not the same as the resource
map. It will have a URI something like:</p>
<pre><code> http://ptsefton.com/2008/09/19/is-this-thing-working.htm#aggregation 
</code></pre>
<p>This imaginary aggregation can spark long discussions.</p>
<p>I can't explain it to you.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://groups.google.com.au/group/oai-ore/browse_thread/thread/8dac5e4c3d58709b">the
list</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>I'm looking forward to a time when there is some consensus on a 'blog
post' type I can attach to the aggregation (failing that we can use
NLA-style normalization a la ARROW discovery).</p>
<div class="slide">
<h1>What are other people doing with ORE?</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>At the <a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/repositories/digirep/index/CRIG_Repository_Challenge_at_OR08">Repository Challenge at OpenRepositories
2008</a>
some UK developers used it to move repository content between
ePrints and Fedora.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There was a recent competition, the <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/ore/RepoCamp2008/">ORE Challenge at RepoCamp
2008</a> in which people
presented various ORE-based ideas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People are writing software libraries to make it easy to use.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>(I don't much like the entry which won the ORE challenge, which was just
a worse way to visualize relationships than you could get using text).</p>
<div class="slide">
<h1>What are we (USQ and friends) doing with it?</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Pushing theses and other research content around, as part of the
JISC-funded ICE-TheOREM project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Harvesting repositories into <a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/projects/fascinator/trac/wiki/">The
Fascinator</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ingesting image collections into The Fascinator, exploring
possibilities for working repositories for eResearch.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Here's a thesis in the ICE content management system.</p>
<div class="slide">
<h1>A BA (Hons) thesis in ICE</h1>
<p><a name="graphics6"></a><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/3f0ee882s526x299.jpg" alt="graphics6" /></p>
<p>This is a complex object with hundreds of HTML and PDF and image files.</p>
<p>Using ICE we can push that thesis over SWORD using ORE to map it, to
ePrints, or Fedora, or (soon) into the VALET system.</p>
</div>
<h1><span id="id6"></span><!--id6--></a>4 Conclusion</h1>
<div class="slide">
<h1>But what will ORE do for me?</h1>
<p>IMHO here are a few examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Replace or supplement OAI-PMH for <strong>moving content</strong> between
repositories <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> not just
harvesting metadata but even upgrading to new software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improve research <strong>tools like Zotero</strong> by making it easier to tell
the tool what to download when saving a local copy of a paper.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Replace the use of METS packages</strong> in work like APSR's OJS to
DSpace demo. [I may be on my own here]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow for <strong>thesis by publication</strong> in a very elegant way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pave the way for a new repository architecture which <strong>understands
content models</strong>. (No more discussion of <em>atomistic</em> versus
<em>compound</em> objects).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h1></h1>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Finally</h1>
<p>To help ORE it along I suggest a minor rebranding. From now on, call
it...</p>

<p>[Update: fixed typo in title]</p>
<p>Jim Downing tagged the presentation I posted on Tuesday <a href="http://ptsefton.com/2008/10/14/what-the-oai-ore-protocol-can-do-for-you.htm">What the
OAI-ORE protocol can do for
you</a>
as <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>Apart from the ORE parts, this
contains a nice exposition of the difference between standards and
interoperability.<span class="spCh spChx201d">”</span></p>
<p>That tag nails a lot of what the talk was about. ICT Standards are nice,
but they don't always guarantee interop. The main example I gave of this
was the National Library of Australia's <a href="http://search.arrow.edu.au/">ARROW Discovery
Service</a>. It creates a normalized view of
what's in Australia's institutional repositories. But the half-finished
harvest we're doing with USQ's Australian University Institutional
Repository Census
(<a href="http://aust-repos-census.usq.edu.au/the-fascinator/search/default">AURIC</a>)
shows the underlying chaos, more politely described as <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>the diverse range of ways repositories
describe their content<span class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>.</p>
<p>The reasonably rosy picture you see at the ARROW Discovery Service is is
not a result of true interop and I fear that it is not scalable. Instead
it depends on a great deal of ongoing work by the maintainers to keep
all the normalizing rules up to date.</p>
<p>There are other situations where data need to be moved around where the
recipient of the data is not going to patiently and laboriously
normalize the your ad-hoc content. Lets digress to look at one: the
forthcoming <a href="http://www.arc.gov.au/era/SEER.htm">ERA</a> for Australia,
which replaces the never-ran RQF.</p>
<p>I think I'm right in saying that the Australian Government is not going
to be particularly understanding if your institution submits its data
using a local 'standard'. If they think that a particular kind of
research output is of type journalArticle then you won't be able to
submit something called <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>Article,
Journal<span class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>.</p>
<p>If you want to use the repository of research outputs to feed a report
to the government system then you will have to source or create some
kind of report, or adaptor or something. Contrary to the fears of at
least one repository manager I have spoken to recently this doesn't
necessarily mean that you have to change what's in your repository
(unless the metadata you've been collecting is inadequate to make the
required distinctions). But it will mean that some bit of software needs
to be created to provide the reports that you need.</p>
<p>I think what's causing some stress is that our repositories don't really
have adaptors in all the places they need them yet. We don't have
anything like those little power adaptors that let you plug European
appliances into Aussie wall-outlets. (By the way, Rick Jelliffe has a
<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/xml/blog/2007/05/power_plugs_and_lowhanging_fru.html">great post on interop relating power points to office document
standards</a>.).</p>
<p>Returning to the ARROW discovery service, the available-on-request
guidelines say (very reasonably):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Populate as many fields as possible. It is a good idea to populate the
Type element at all times, and to use the MACAR list to do so.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But there is no straightforward way using standard IR software to both
use a MACAR type for the external view of a repository, vs the internal
view. At USQ, for example the official university nomenclature for
theses and dissertations is at odds with the MACAR types.</p>
<p>So, here's a three step process that I think could move us towards
better interop. that <strong>could</strong> be made more sustainable and less of a
drain on the NLA:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The NLA <strong>publish all the rules</strong> they use to normalize repository
content in a public place. This might not be in the form of a
standard, but it can be made human readable.</p>
<p>At USQ we've been adapting NLA rules in our work on The Fascinator
and with the AUIRC, and they're going to be in The Fascinator's
distribution as an example.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The repository community <strong>works to create adaptors</strong> for the
various repositories so that they can move the normalization closer
to home. Instead of feeding whatever you happen to have to the
long-suffering ARROW discovery service you take responsibility for
mapping your local view of your data to the shared standardized
view.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>After a testing period</strong> the NLA switch over to the new system and
start rejecting out-of-band input.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is of course, just an example for discussion, to illuminate the
general issue of interoperability. I don't set NLA policy. It's not my
service.</p>
<p>There are lots of ways this normalization could be done, but how about
using an OAI-PMH <strong>adaptor</strong>. Hook one side of it to your repository and
expose the other side to the harvester. It would sit there quietly
normalizing the content.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter where the adaptor runs, but it <strong>does matter who looks
after the normalization rules</strong>. It's not sustainable to expect staff at
the consumer end to keep adapting to non-standard inputs unless there is
a very clear case for ongoing funding for such activities.</p>
<p>Being a techo I think of this normalizing OAI-PMH adaptor as a proxy and
it turns out that a proxy is actually one of the recommendations from:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a small pilot project to set up a European doctoral e-theses
Demonstrator. The work was funded by the Joint Information Systems
Committee (JISC) in the UK, the National Library of Sweden and
SURFfoundation in the Netherlands. The project has been performed by
SURFfoundation.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.surffoundation.nl/download/ETD_LessonsLearned_Full-Report+Annex.pdf">http://www.surffoundation.nl/download/ETD_LessonsLearned_Full-Report+Annex.pdf</a><span
style="font-size:9pt; "><span class="T3"> </span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It mentions proxies:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The best solution is to create national proxy services. These proxies
are gateways that on one side harvest the metadata from local
Institutional Repositories, and on the other side have an OAI-PMH gate
that can be used for service providers to harvest the national proxy.
The advantage of a national proxy is that it can centrally normalise
the metadata, and deliver unambiguous metadata to service providers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ARROW discovery service is already a national proxy <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> it normalizes and acts as a gateway -
but I am concerned about the centralized maintenance of the normalizing
rules <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> there's not much of a
disincentive to changing stuff around if someone is going to clean up
after you, is there?</p>
<p>From the same report, the tedium of normalizing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This has to be done for every type of field of every repository, which
is a labour intensive enterprise when offering a high quality service.
This is a short term solution, the long term solution will be that
repositories offer standardised content that can be easily used for
interoperable services.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> what I'm suggesting is
finding a way to give the NLA proxy/normalizer back to the providers.
One way would be to make software available that lets people adapt their
OAI-PMH feed without having to change their repository. Or the NLA could
make the rule-sets editable by staff from the sites they harvest.</p>
<p>Given the current state of the repository art I would not propose that a
harvester service suddenly start enforcing standards (ie rejecting non
standard input). But, if we could come up with some freely available
adaptor infrastructure then would it be reasonable for the NLA to, after
a giving people time to adapt, stop accepting ad-hoc data and stop being
responsible for making the service consistent? (That's a genuine
question. Would it? Use the comments below if you have an opinion).</p>
<p>There are other models.</p>
<p>The Zotero research tool project, for example relies on volunteers
writing vast numbers of adaptors to let Zotero harvest metadata from
various kinds of web sites. I don't see anybody seriously suggesting
that all this work is pushed back to the sites. I wonder about opening
adaptor rules up to everyone wiki style. What would happen?</p>
<p>If it turns out that the ARROW discovery service is not all that
important to the owners of the repositories it harvests then there's no
use expecting them to take over responsibility for normalizing their
outputs. In that case it's either it's worth supporting at a national
level, via a community or it's not worth having. Repository owners <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> do you value the service?</p>
<p>Finally, a reflection on the process I went through in writing this
post. What I thought I was sitting down to write was a survey of
potential ways to share and reuse the normalizing cross-walks that have
been developed at the NLA. But in the process of thinking it through I
came to the conclusion that a normalizing OAI-PMH adaptor is a pretty
good idea. Then I realized that the Arrow Discovery Service is already
doing that job. I was thinking about all sorts of complicated machinery
but now I think that we have nearly all the technology we really need,
it's just a matter of distributing it the right way.</p>
<p>Returning to Jim's perceptive comment re standards versus interop; the
OAI-PMH Standard is more or less working for IR's in Australia but the
interoperability is limping along. I think we now have a great
opportunity to think about what interoperability is worth to us as a
community and put the power into the right hands to make it happen.
Should it be central, at each repository site, or crowd-sourced? Choose
one or more, or give up.</p>
<p>I'm very interested in this as a test case for how we handle content
models in OAI-ORE, if we want to start swapping theses and journal
issues and the like are we going to be able to get working interop from
the start or will we need to go through the same kind of process as
we're going through with OAI-PMH?</p>

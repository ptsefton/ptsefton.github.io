<p>Chris Rusbridge <a href="http://digitalcuration.blogspot.com/2008/10/open-access-day.html">points
out</a>
that at the ARROW day on Tuesday week nobody mentioned Open Access Day.</p>
<p>I knew it was Open Access day when I was preparing my
<a href="http://ptsefton.com/2008/10/14/what-the-oai-ore-protocol-can-do-for-you.htm">talk</a>,
and I meant to mention it but I forgot<a href="#ftn0"><span
style="vertical-align: super;"><span
class="footnote">*</span></span></a> as did everyone else,
apparently. So happy Open Access day everyone. I hope this doesn't say
anything too significant about the ARROW community. (I do have a theory
that because ARROW became involved in a rather drawn out and complex
software development and deployment process that there was a tendency to
focus on technical matters over policy for <strong>some</strong> people <strong>some</strong> of
the time and that some of us may have lost sight of why were we doing
this in the first place.)</p>
<p>Ironically, I had an approach very shortly after I posted my talk, from
the publisher of a toll-access publication, asking if I'd like to work
up my talk into a paper. My first response was that yes I am interested.
But maybe I should only bother with full OA publishers. [Update: I
should have mention that Chris says that that's what he does]</p>
<p>Any advice? Should those of us in this business be making a point of
doing everything as full open access (is that gold?)? Green? Some other
<a href="http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeoinfo.html#colours">colour</a> I don't know
about? The terminology in this space is very confusing <span
class="spCh spChx2013">â€“</span> I don't even know how to express my
question!</p>
<p>[Update: I made a couple of minor edits to this post]</p>

<div style="font-size: .9em;">
<p><span class="footnote"></span>
<a href="#ftn0-text">*</a> I did remember that Wednseday was Ride to Work day and
mention that in my presentation. I was sorry to miss out on riding (and
two breakfasts) in Toowoomba but I didn't go so far as to bring a bike
and take it for a gratuitous ride across the Brisbane CBD.</p>

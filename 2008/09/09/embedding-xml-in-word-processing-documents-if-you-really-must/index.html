Embedding XML in word processing documents (if you really must) 
</h1>

<p>Rick Jelliffe has posted a
<a href="http://news.oreilly.com/2008/08/wrapping-with-foreign-elements.html">comparison</a>
of how foreign XML can be embed in OOXML (that's the XML format for
Microsoft Office) and ODF (the Open Document Format).</p>
<p>Rick starts with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First the caveat: Word and OpenOffice are not general-purpose XML
editors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right. That means that if you do decide that there's a case for
embedding extra XML in OOXML or ODF then you are going to have to supply
add-ons to the applications in question to edit it. So what does this
mean for the two formats? (As usual I'll just talk about the word
processing format here and ignore spreadsheets and the rest.)</p>
<p><strong>For OOXML</strong>, you would have to create a Word Addin such as the one
I've looked at here before. There could be business case for that, but
you'd have to accept that your documents were only going to be editable
in Word 2007+. I gather from recent posts that Rick does some work on
projects where this does make good business sense.</p>
<p><strong>For OpenOffice.org</strong> you're out of luck. Rick's tests show that
OpenOffice.org strips out foreign markup. It's unclear whether this is
conformant behaviour or not:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But the bottom line for foreign elements as wrappers in ODF and OOXML
is that ODF allows them to be stripped out while OOXML doesn't allow
that; neither of course require that any particular application
understands them. The bottom line for OpenOffice and Office seems to
be that OpenOffice strips them (dangerously, but perhaps allowed
because of bad drafting of that part of the ODF standard) while Office
2007 does allow them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As<a href="http://delicious.com/ptsefton/odfconformance+ptsefton">I've covered here many times ODF interoperability between
applications is basically
non-existent</a>
except between Microsoft Office and OpenOffice.org and its derivatives
where some things work quite well. Bottom line is, ODF doesn't have any
formal notion of what's conformant <span class="spCh spChx2013">â€“</span>
it's up to application developers to implement the bits they feel like
implementing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The OpenDocument specification does not specify which elements and
attributes conforming application must, should, or may support. The
intention behind this is to ensure that the OpenDocument specification
can be used by as many implementations as possible, even if these
applications do not support some or many of the elements and
attributes defined in this specification. Viewer applications for
instance may not support all editing relates elements and attributes
(like change tracking), other application may support only the content
related elements and attributes, but none of the style related ones.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/12572/OpenDocument-v1.1-os.pdf">http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/12572/OpenDocument-v1.1-os.pdf</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think for most uses a much better bet is to use microformats which
leverage the built in features of the formats. These not only work in
the aforementioned major applications for OOXML or ODF, in many cases
they interchange between the formats quite nicely as well.</p>
<p>What's a word processing microformat? One example would be using a
one-cell borderless table with a paragraph in it of style 'h-warning' to
indicate a bit of content that's a warning, to use Rick's example. Ok,
so using a table is inelegant, but it works in both Word and
OpenOffice.org writer and will survive round tripping between .doc and
.odt and .docx. You could use a frame, which is a more semantically
neutral element and sacrifice some interop, or you could use styles
only, which is a bit harder for users to manage and more error prone.
Actually, Rick gives an example of a styles-based microformat approach.</p>
<p><a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/">We</a> use this kind of technique to do things
like <a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/introduction/about.slide.htm">generate slide
shows</a> from text
embedded in <a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/introduction/about.htm">documents</a>,
and we're developing methods for embedding metadata in documents using
styles.</p>

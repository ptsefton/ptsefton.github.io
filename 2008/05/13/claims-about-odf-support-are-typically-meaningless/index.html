<p>I know I'm repeating myself a bit. But as <a href="http://ptsefton.com/2008/02/22/opendocument-format-support-not-as-great-as-the-cheer-squad-keep-saying.htm">you
know</a>
there's a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_applications_supporting_OpenDocument">Wikipedia
page</a>
about applications that support the Open Document Format and it gets
quoted and <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?as_lq=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FList_of_applications_supporting_OpenDocument&amp;btnG=Search">linked
to</a>.
A lot.</p>
<p>I linked to Peter Murray Rust
<a href="http://ptsefton.com/2008/05/12/some-comments-on-ooxml-odf-and-microsoft-word.htm">yesterday</a>,
and one of the commenters on his blog also talks about the number of
<a href="http://www.simbiosys.ca/blog/2008/05/11/what-is-wrong-with-ooxml/">implementations.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>OpenOffice.org is only one of the tools that can generate it, there
are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_applications_supporting_OpenDocument">several
others</a>
as well as various converters (e.g. <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/star/odf_plugin/index.jsp">SUN<span
class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>s MS Office
plugin</a>,
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/odf-converter">Clever Age ODF
translator</a>) available
for MS Word users.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But folks, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=OpenDocument_software&amp;oldid=207546134">as of 2008-05-13 mid afternoon Toowoomba time, that
Wikipedia
page</a>
is not much help to people who might want to, like you know work on real
documents. GoogleDocs, for example will throw away your styles if you
happen to care about them. And why would you? It's a web two-dot-oh
world now what do we need with styles?</p>
<p>I'm going to get around to editing that page, but I'm not an expert so I
have held off.</p>
<p>I just know that it's not useful. Lots of things on that list don't work
with <strong>my</strong> ODF documents all created with applications derived from
OpenOffice.org.</p>
<p>As part of my homework for when I do engage the page I went to the spec.</p>
<p>What does the ODF spec
(<a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=office#odf11">v1.1</a>)
say about conformance? You need only read the first sentence of this
extract, which I have highlighted for your convenience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The</strong> <strong>OpenDocument</strong> <strong>specification does not specify which
elements and attributes conforming application must, should, or may
support.</strong> The intention behind this is to ensure that the
OpenDocument specification can be used by as many implementations as
possible, even if these applications do not support some or many of
the elements and attributes defined in this specification. Viewer
applications for instance may not support all editing relates elements
and attributes (like change tracking), other application may support
only the content related elements and attributes, but none of the
style related ones.</p>
<p>Even typical office applications may only support a subset of the
elements and attributes defined in this specification. They may for
instance not support lists within text boxes or may not support some
of the language related element and attributes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So you don't have to do anything in particular to claim to support ODF.
Maybe just allowing the top level element would be enough?</p>
<p>We clearly need to add some detail to the Wikipedia page about who
supports what specifically.</p>
<p><strong>My</strong> working definition of support for ODF (the text format is
actually what I care about) is people using our word processing
templates to edit files interoperably with Writer and some other
application. And you know what? There's nothing outrageous in any of our
templates, but the <strong>only</strong> applications that work are ones that are
based on the original Star Office code base that spawned OpenOffice.org.</p>
<p>This is unsurprising. The file format was built around OpenOffice.org.
Lots of people point out that nobody but Microsoft will be able to build
an office suite that supports OOXML. People, this is the same process at
work.</p>
<p>Let me tell you about a quick experiment I did. I looked up the bit in
the ODF spec about lists. Apparently you can have a thing called a
list-header at the start of the list.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <span class="Def"><span style="font-style:normal; "><span
class="T2">list header</span></span></span> is a special kind of list
item. It contains one or more paragraphs that are displayed before a
list. The paragraphs are formatted like list items but they do not
have a preceding number or bullet. The list header is represented by
the list header element.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I made a .odt using NeoOffice, put in a list using the default style
<code>List 1</code> saved it, unzipped it and added a list-header to the start of
the list, then rezipped it and opened in NeoOffice. Hmm, well it does
display, but the Writer interface seems to know nothing about list
headers. The only way to create one seems to be outside of the
application. Having a feature like this creates some very serious
weirdness. You can load up a document with multiple paragraphs in the
list header and they are preserved but if you try to add one then you
just get a normal list item.</p>
<p>Now I know this is not quite in line with what I'm saying about the file
format being largely derived from OpenOffice.org. I don't know the
history of this element but OpenOffice.org doesn't support it in any
useful way. Looks like something added by a standards committee raised
on SGML with a clear idea of what makes a 'good' document format and not
much consideration about what makes a usable word processor interface
but that's just a guess.</p>
<p>Lets talk about the formatting I got from my experiment. Is this what
the spec really means?</p>
<p><span
style="display: block"><a name="graphics1"></a><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/62f474d9s153x68.jpg" alt="graphics1"></span>See
how the list header (Header 1) is indented? Not formatting I can imagine
using. But it seems to be what the spec says. <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>The paragraphs are formatted like list
items but they do not have a preceding number or bullet.<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span></p>
<p>How many of the ODF cheer squad have read the standard? Dealt with
document interop issues? Me, I have only glanced at the OOXML spec and
so I don't go around telling people about how bad it is, but on the few
occasions I have looked at ODF and tested support for various things in
Writer I have found problems or lack of support in OOo. The good thing
with OpenOffice.org, of course is that you can tell Sun about the bug
and it will likely get fixed sooner or later, particularly if you can
rally enough supporters to vote.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that if you want to work with ODT you have to check
out whether the other applications are going to support the bit you want
to use. I will get around to changing that wikipedia page to be more
useful.</p>

<p>One of the things we're thinking about at <a href="http://usq.edu.au/">USQ</a> is
how researchers might integrate data into their publications. This will
be key to the Australian National Data Service.</p>
<p>I have posted a few things here before about stuff like embedding
chemistry, maps, and graphing. I'll start <a href="http://del.icio.us/ptsefton/ptsefton%2Bdataintegrationfordocuments">keeping
track</a>of
those and other posts under the del.icio.us tag
<a href="http://del.icio.us/ptsefton/ptsefton%2BDataIntegrationForDocuments">DataIntegrationForDocuments</a>
for want of a better tag.</p>
<p>(You know, I don't bother with WordPress categories, I use del.icio.us
as an outboard organizer for my site and have one less thing to worry
about when I migrate it . Hmm <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> I
wonder if my automated backup of my del.icio.us tags is still working).</p>
<p>I think one of the big kinds of data integration we need to work on is
getting geo-spatial data hooked in to documents. This is potentially
useful for lots of disciplines and there are lots of tools out there
waiting to be mashed up.</p>
<p>But as usual there are issues. Just like the<a href="http://ptsefton.com/2008/04/24/some-thoughts-on-vendor-lock-in-from-the-domestic-to-the-institutional-is-apple-mac-os-x-evil.htm">stuff I talked about
recently regarding metadata for images and potential vendor
lockin</a>
we need to be very careful about how we encode our data for the long
term and use the sexy online services wisely and within their licenses.</p>
<p>Licenses are really important; you can't just grab online maps and use
them however you like, if you want preservation-quality maps it's a
whole different issue than just throwing up a Google map. More on that
in the future.</p>
<p>I wanted to link to an example of some great mashing up of data and maps
from the Bidwern project at ANU, but today<a href="http://www.anu.edu.au/bidwern/page5/page4/page4.html">the map
page</a> there is
returning an error about keys for Google maps. That helps make my point
that we need to think about storing important data independently of any
particular service that might go away at any time. I'm sure that in the
case of Bidwern the data are safe, but researchers, don't just go and
'build a service where the data you need are all Google dependent and
stored only on Google's servers, OK?</p>
<p>Over a <a href="http://del.icio.us/ptsefton/ptsefton+AdventuresInGeocoding">series of
posts</a> I
will look at some stuff I'm learning about how to use documents and
pictures with geographical information embedded in them, and think about
how we should use services like Google Maps without locking ourselves
in. On one level this is about something I did on the weekend, but it's
also relevant to the kinds of things our researchers are wanting to and
will be wanting to do. Just be thankful I didn't plot all my veggie
plants on a map and bore you with that.</p>
<p>This time, I report on a rather exciting expedition I went on with the
<a href="http://toowoombabug.blogspot.com/">Toowoomba Bicycle Users Group</a>
Hazard Inspection Team <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> aka the
TBUG HIT Squad. The squad last Sunday was Hugh, David and me. Not sure
what Hugh was doing there though 'cos he rides a
<a href="http://www.greenspeed.com.au/">trike</a>; I'll see what I can do about
getting him expelled or at least compelled to turn up on a proper
conveyance. Really, those <a href="http://kentsbike.blogspot.com/2008/01/why-doesnt-everyone-ride-recumbents.html">recumbent
riders</a>
should have got the message <a href="http://www.helsinki.fi/~tlinden/winforb.html">back in
1934</a>.</p>
<p>We took a slow ride from the Southern edge of town to the Oxygen cafe,
looking at Ruthven street with new eyes. I have ridden parts of that
hundreds of times in <em><span>just deal with it</span></em> mode, but it's an
eye-opener to look in detail at all the hazards.</p>
<p>I strapped-on a GPS (a three year old antique Garmin eTrex) and a
compact digital camera.</p>
<p>Hugh kept notes and both David and I took pictures.</p>
<p>I have been able to synchronize the tracklog from my GPS with the
pictures, by getting the clock in both cameras set to within a minute or
so of the spot-on GPS. We'll see more and more software and hardware
that can make this a smooth process but for now I had to use a couple of
commandline tools to get the job done. I will leave boring you with the
how-to stuff for another post.</p>
<p>Anyway <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> the result is some very
arty pictures complete with embedded metadata.</p>
<p>The view from <a href="http://www.digikam.org/">Digikam</a> is this:</p>
<p><span
style="display: block"><a name="graphics1"></a><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/eec7f58s552x330.jpg" alt="graphics1"></span></p>
<p>There's Hugh at 612.5 metres above sea level. We reckoned he could have
gone under that tray-back but he took his life in his hands and rode
around.</p>
<p>Now that I had my geotagged piccies I uploaded them to Flickr. but guess
what? While Flickr recognized the tags I had embedded.
(What/ToowoombaBUG/HazardInspectionTeam) it didn't like the
geo-metadata. It wants the metadata expressed as tags in its own Flickry
way.</p>
<p>Google's Picasa site, on the other hand recognizes the geographical data
nicely as long as you don't let its uploader software scale down the
images. But guess what? While it groks my mistyped captions Google's
service doesn't recognize the tags.</p>
<p>It's the usual story. You have to figure out what works and what
doesn't. Mistakes with valuable data could be very upsetting so we need
people helping our research communities with this stuff.</p>
<p>By the way, this is an interesting kind of narrative genre. I can type
parts of a story into the metadata of the pictures and the computer can
sort them for me using the time stamp, to assemble the story but they
could be served up other ways so the captions should try to be clear
enough to understand on their own. I know I need practice at that.</p>
<p>Here's a screenshot of <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com.au/ptsefton/ToowoombaBUGHazardInspectionTeam/photo#map">the
result</a>:</p>
<p><a name="graphics2"></a><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/2a66246ds193x300.jpg" alt="graphics2"></p>
<p>The pictures have metadata in them that should stick with them forever.
My insightful comments and skillful photography will no doubt delight
road geeks of the future. Google's Picasa service might go away or I
might take them down, but I'm reasonably happy that I have
future-proof-ish data that will work with other services in the future.
At the very least I can get a paper map or some old fashioned
navigational instruments and a clock that knows what time it is in
Greenwich and use the latitude and longitude.</p>
<p>When we get ICE version 2 out the door at the end of June we can
consider how we might make ICE more aware of geotagged images, and
potentially other data, but before that I will post on another quick
experiment I did that finds points in web pages and shows them on a map.</p>

<p>So the conversation that Chris Rusbridge started about low-effort
repositories rolls on. Chris <a href="http://digitalcuration.blogspot.com/2008/06/reaction-to-negative-click-repositories.html">summarizes some of the
responses</a>.
Including
<a href="http://ptsefton.com/2008/06/11/deflation-in-repository-clicks.htm">mine</a>
and broadens the discussion to bring in some of the stuff that Andy
Powell has been saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Andy wants repositories to be more consistent with the web
architecture. He spoke at a Talis workshop recently; his slides are
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/4fehq8">here</a> (on Slideshare, one of his models
for a repository).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This reminded me that earlier this year people in my network were
talking about Andy's
<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/eduservfoundation/repositories-thru-the-looking-glass">keynote</a>
at <a href="http://www.vala.org.au/vala2008/keyn2008.htm">VALA.</a> We responded to
the ripples running through the Oz-repos community by putting a project
proposal to <a href="http://arrow.usq.edu.au/">ARROW</a> in Australia to start
working on a repository ingest application that is much more 'of the
web' than those we have now.</p>
<p>The ARROW board didn't approve that one, I'm sure it wasn't the just the
name that was wrong but I gather that was not popular. And it was a
truly stupid name.</p>
<p>I had to think of something quickly so I called it VICE-SQUAD in the
spirit of highly contrived acronyms that seems to pervade the ARROW
community.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>VICE SQUAD means (VITAL-compatible Integrated Content
Environment-driven Service-oriented Queryable User-friendly
Application for Data-acquisition)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's a bit of the proposal we put, which seems to be along the lines
of what Chris from the Logical Operator blog <a href="http://www.logicaloperator.net/2008/06/more-on-repositories/">suggested in response to
Chris R</a>.
From our proposal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The goal of this project is to build a smart user-friendly repository
ingest system for VITAL and/or other Fedora based repositories, which
will be implemented in the Integrated Content Environment (ICE)
service framework. The system will be released as open source
software. The application will be a stand-alone ingest system with
back-end coupling to ICE.</p>
<p><span class="T1">The project will attempt to create an innovative
interface for repository ingest which is quite different from other
approaches, allowing users to upload content into a w</span><em>orking
repository</em><span class="T1">, or </span><em>workbench</em><span class="T1">
from where it can be shared with the world (sharing with defined
groups is out of scope for this project but will be dealt with in a
separate USQ project) and/or submitted for ingest into the repository;
ie pushed over the </span><em>curation boundary</em><span
class="T3">1</span><span class="T1">.</span></p>
<p>It will consist of three interfaces:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>A dead-simple user interface</strong> for academics to share their work
as quickly as possible and tag it with free-form metadata. They
will upload items to a workbench where they will be able to work
on them further, or merely mark them for ingest into the
repository.</p>
<p>(see this blog post from the JISC repositories interest group for
some thinking along the same lines, with pointers to a commercial
service called box.net which could serve as a model for the
sharing-features proposed here if adapted to an academic context.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A graphical user interface for repository staff</strong> or advanced
users to edit MODS metadata for a record and turn the user's
initial tags into formal metadata, including the ability to edit
existing metadata records from VITAL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="country:US; language:en; "><span class="T5">A
</span></span><strong><span>seamless</span></strong><span
style="country:US; language:en; "><span class="T5"> tie-in to a
structured authoring environment, so that papers authored in such
an environment can be sent to a repository with a single
click</span></span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to the two interfaces there will be behind-the-scenes
'smarts' that can extract metadata from documents and produce HTML and
PDF automatically, using technologies already developed by USQ.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the time has come for someone to build a repository which has
the simple ePrints approach to collecting metadata, with an option to
make it even simpler and just go with tags if that's all the energy the
depositor can muster.</p>
<p>Our proposal goes on to talk about MODS and MARC and METS but I think
maybe the time is right to do RDF, especially if the <a href="http://bibliontology.com/">Bibliographic
Ontology</a> makes it into
<a href="http://zotero.org/">Zotero</a>. And we should look at
<a href="http://www.openarchives.org/ore/">ORE</a> support rather than bother with
METS.</p>
<p>For those who care to add more higher-quality metadata <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> and often this a librarian tidying up
later <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> there needs to be just a
little bit more smarts than ePrints or DSpace offer with their flat
metadata in the area of stuff like research affiliation and researcher
identity, stored in RDF, with an option to serialize it in other
metadata formats as required.</p>
<p>While we didn't get that project up with ARROW we will have another
opportunity to build on the forthcoming <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/digitalrepositories2007/theorem-ice.aspx">TheOREM-ICE
work</a>.</p>
<p>We have a big need for simple sharing in ICE right now, and I imagine
that this will be true for thesis writing too <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> wouldn't it be great to share your PhD
draft with reviewers and draft-readers in a simple way?</p>
<p>One thing I'd like to do is to turn on document sharing via an obscure
non-guessable URL so that people can drop in and comment on my documents
using ICE's inline annotation systems without authentication. Or for
more formal collaboration, I want to be able to create ad hoc workgroups
preferably using a single sign on service of some kind. Once we get
through some of the nasty issues we're having with the ICE 2 beta
version we will no doubt start adding those collaborative features.</p>
<p>Then when TheOREM kicks off we'll have an ICE to repository gateway
pumping content into DSpace, Fedora and ePrints.</p>
<p>What's needed as well are some simple services to let people upload
stuff and push it out. ICE already lets you push to a blog via ATOM (all
the posts here are done that way), but we could add SlideShare and
Flickr and suchlike as additional services, as well as a simple web
sharing interface that is less controlled than the Institutional
Repository. As Peter Murray-Rust says: <a href="http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/murrayrust/?p=1147">Don<span
class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>t use Institutional Repositories put it
on the web</a>.</p>

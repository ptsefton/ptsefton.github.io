<h1> 
Lemon8 XML beta released

<p>The PKP people have released a beta of
<a href="http://pkp.sfu.ca/lemon8">Lemon8-XML</a>, (L8X) their journal-oriented
word processor-driven XML publishing system.</p>
<p>I tried out the demo server with an <a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/">ICE</a> test
document.</p>
<p><strong>The bad news</strong> is that the service had significant problems with my
document; It could not locate author metadata, incorrectly identified
some ordinary text as being citations, and lost most of the document
text, which is obviously a very major issue.</p>
<p><strong>The good news</strong> is that MJ Suhonos from PKP was onto me straight away
with an email and is keen to work on support for styles in general and
ICE styles in particular. (It's <a href="http://pkp.sfu.ca/lemon8_faq">in the
FAQ</a> that we will collaborate on this).</p>
<p>If the PKP team can get a decent structure guessing application to work
on arbitrary input that would be great, but even better would be to
close the loop and give back documents with more structure than you put
in. At the ICE project we will help however we can.</p>
<p>If it was me doing this I would break this problem into two parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Build a converter that can take <strong>structured</strong> word processing
documents and map them to the NLM XML format used by L8X. ICE offers
one well worked out structure for generic documents, others may
exist for specific formats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build a structure-guessing application to <strong>add structure</strong> to word
processing documents (something which Ian Barnes has been chipping
away at for a while).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>With both of these in place you can improve documents in the wild as you
go; every time someone submits a draft add styles and give it back to
them, rather than trying to guess structure at the end. I would like to
see this embedded in the OJS journal management system from PKP so that
authors get rapid and continual feedback every time they upload a draft.
This would allow some editorial and review processes to take place in an
HTML interface as well <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> rather than
via PDF on word processing files.</p>
<p>If you leave L8X as the final step, authors will have little feedback as
to how they can improve the structure of their drafts.</p>
<p>My two-part plan would re-ordering sections in L8X become redundant
<span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> word processors have outlining
tools with which you can reorder content, so why try to do it through an
HTML interface?</p>
<p>On a technical note, last time I looked at L8X I concluded that Docvert
is a weak link <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> it tries to to use
XSLT to guess structure; our experience with ICE was that XSLT (version
one at least) was not a productive way to do this as the austere
functional programming environment in XSLT made the structure-reasoning
code very hard to maintain and very slow, so we moved to more
traditional parser written in Python which is much easier for typical
programmers to work with.</p>

A few words on magic

<p>MJ Suhonos from PKP has patiently explained where I got some things
wrong about Lemon8XML in <a href="http://ptsefton.com/2008/06/23/lemon8-xml-beta-released.htm">my previous hasty
post</a>.</p>
<p>I'd like to pick up one theme from MJ's post. MJ says (with emphasis by
me):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The larger problem, of course, is that <strong>L8X is encumbered, in a way,
by</strong> <a href="http://cavlec.yarinareth.net/2007/08/30/apologies-and-musings-on-progress/"><strong>the common
expectation</strong></a>
<strong>that it should just &quot;magically&quot; work on whatever format the author
or user is providing</strong> -- it is an application that is designed to
solve, in part, an infinitely-unsolvable problem. So, the user has to
meet the application halfway.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree that this expectation that tools should perform <strong>magic</strong> is a
problem. We see this in the HTML export from word processors; they take
arbitrary input and turn it into HTML. In the inevitable absence of
magic you typically get sub-standard output.</p>
<p>I understand the requirement to try to understand the structure of ad
hoc documents if you can, but I don't think it's a good idea to
encourage people to keep creating them; if L8X has a version of <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>meet me half way<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> which involves direct formatting instead
of styles then that will be a step backwards in my opinion. My version
of meet me half way would be at least to try to get people to use
headings. If they don't then the structure guesser will step in, try to
guess and <strong>give them their document back to correct</strong> when the
inevitable errors occur.</p>
<p>I took a look at the single sample document for L8X on the demo site.
It's clear that the structure-guesser part of the application is going
to have to be very clever to work well. It seems, for example, that the
goal is to detect captions either before or after a graphic or table
even when they have no special formatting. Introducing edge cases like
short paragraphs both before and after an image seem to cause it
problems, including loss of text but I could be wrong, again.</p>
<p>(I've had a look at the document parser code and it is taking into
account paragraph length, and doing some reasoning based on text-size
and formatting attributes).</p>
<p>So, even though I had some of the architecture wrong, I <strong>still</strong> think
that Lemon8 XML would be vastly more useful if it had a two part
architecture:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Styled word processing document to XML conversion</strong>, with the
obvious caveat that if you're turing a generic format into a domain
specific one you're going to be producing stuff that doesn't use the
whole of the target format and may have gaps that need to be filled
in.</p>
<p>Lemon8 XML has its own XML format, but I'm wondering if it couldn't
just use ODF which is a well specified standard, with the ability to
give the document back to the user. (Checking with MJ via email
about this).</p>
<p>The goal would be to get as many people using this mode as possible
because it is the least work for everyone <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> no guessing strucutre required if
people can use markup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ad hoc-formatting to styled word processing conversion</strong> using the
best available heuristics to guess structure and <strong>give the document
back to the author in an improved form</strong>. As far as I can tell
that's not a goal for the PKP team, but the code is out there so we
could do it, using their algorithm. We're looking into it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It is important to help our colleagues who are authoring documents in
word processors to<a href="http://del.icio.us/ptsefton/usestyles/">use styles</a>.
It's good for them. It will improve their working lives. And it will
open the door for them to start dealing with real eResearch and the
semantic web. A project like the
<a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/digitalrepositories2007/theorem-ice.aspx">TheOREM-ICE</a>
would be impossible with documents like the L8X sample document.</p>

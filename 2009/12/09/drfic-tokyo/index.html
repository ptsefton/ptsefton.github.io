<h2>Suggestions for collaboration based on hard-won experience</h2>
<div class="body">
<div>
<p>On Tuesday last week I took to the stage at the University of the
Sunshine Coast Innovation Centre for the
<a href="http://cairss.caul.edu.au/">CAIRSS</a> community day, I talked about seven
things we're doing wrong in the world of repositories. Negative? Maybe,
but there's no point in spending all our time patting ourselves on the
back; I thought I might spark some discussion, and it seemed to work. My
talk was in the session on software, so most of what I had to say was to
do with technology, but some of it was policy and governance. That
presentation will be posted on the CAIRSS site soon with commentary on
the CAIRSS blog.</p>
<p>By Friday I was in Tokyo, at the Tokyo Institute of Technology in a
building rejoicing in the name <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>Tokyo Tech Front<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>, another nice new venue. This time I was
presenting a similar but more positive and less technically oriented
list that I put together with Kate Watson, my CAIRSS colleague. The
theme of the conference was <a href="http://drfic2009.jp/index_en.htm">Open Access now and in the future, from the
global and Asia-Pacific points of
view</a> so we put together a summary of
where we think Australian university Institutional Repositories are up
to from an on-the-ground perspective, with some suggestions for future
collaboration based on our own experience of four years or so of IR
development in Australia.</p>
<p>There was a lot of emphasis on the Open Access movement at this
conference, along with discussion of how to recruit repository deposits.
I think the first lot of Australian IRs were mostly motivated by Open
Access, but Katie and I note that while this is still a concern, the
biggest driver for an Australian university to have a repository is the
good old ERA: <a href="http://www.arc.gov.au/era/default.htm">The Excellence in Research for Australia
Initiative</a>. Open Access might
get you cited, extend the reach of your research and chip away at
rationalising the scholarly communications process, but the ERA will get
government cash. I think that the ERA is having a galvanising effect on
populating repositories in Australia, at least with metadata and 'dark'
publisher's versions of articles, maybe at the cost of openness, for
now.</p>
<p>I won't try to summarise <a href="http://drfic2009.jp/program_.htm">everything on the
program</a>, but Alicia L<span
class="spCh spChxf3">ó</span>pez Medina  of COAR/UNED had a strong
thread about OA running through her talk, as did Salvatore Mele from
CERN, which is unsurprising given that those physicists are very OA,
using <a href="http://arxiv.org/">ArXiv</a> as they do. Salvatore also talked about
<a href="http://scoap3.org/">SCOAP^^3^^</a>. As the site says a <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>A consortium facilitates Open Access
publishing in High Energy Physics by re-directing subscription
money.<span class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> (Alicia pointed out that the
percentage of literature covered by SCOAP3 is very small so we should
not relax our efforts to recruit deposits just yet).</p>
<p>On the recruitment side, David Shulenburger (Association of Public and
Land-grant Universities) talked a lot about repository deposit mandates.
The chair, Syun Tutiya asked me to comment on the state of repository
mandates in Australia, and I said that I think that the whole open
access thing has gone off the boil a bit in Australia, probably because
of the ERA, especially since some of the requirements for the ERA are
the opposite of OA, people have been figuring out how to limit, rather
than promote access to some content. But I couldn't help noting that we
have mandatory income tax in Australia, and some people go to great
lengths to avoid it, (that's why I think we need to re-brand it as
'sharing' which we are all taught from an early age is a good thing, an
idea that resonates with the success of services like
<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/">slideshare</a> in academia).</p>
<p>This was my first time presenting with a translator, so I was glad that
the presentation was relatively simple; I took it one point at a time
and paused for the Japanese version. The talk following mine, by Hideki
Uchijima (Kanazawa University) summarised the state of play in Japan; I
hope the presentation turns up online, as I have lost my printed
proceedings. From memory about a quarter of circa 800 (!) universities
have repositories, although that sounds better if you look at unis that
award PhDs; and while there are metadata standards to which most
repositories adhere, I gather that the Japanese experience of harvesting
multiple repositories is like ours in Australia 'some normalisation
required' via 'crosswalks'.</p>
<p>I was interested to see Susan Gibbons presenting on the outcome of
University of Rochester's approach of <em>Studying Users to Design a Better
Repository</em>, resulting in their new IR+ software, written by Nathan
Sarr, which Tim McCallum is installing in our CAIRSS sandbox so
Australian IR people can kick the tyres.</p>
<p>Mikiko Tanifuji of the National Institute for Materials Science pointed
out to me in a break that the situation in Japan is like Australia in
that <strong>we</strong> have CAIRSS which is for universities, and <strong>they</strong> have the
Digital Repository Federation which is likewise focussed, and wouldn't
it be nice if we could be a bit more inclusive. Sounds like a good idea
to me. Anybody care to fund it?</p>
<p>My 3 votes for <a href="http://drfic2009.jp/program_en1.htm">the posters</a> went
to: 16, 17 and 10.</p>
<p>The slides follow below, thanks to a new feature in The Fascinator that
allows blog posts (and soon repository deposits) to be composed of more
than one digital item.</p>

<h1> 
Bye Bye Word 2007 Custom XML ? 
</h1>
<h2>2009-12-23 </h2>

<div>
<div class="page-toc">
</div>
<div>
<p>I have argued here repeatedly that building applications using Microsoft
Word's Custom XML feature is a spectacularly bad idea, but it turns out
that I missed the best reason of all not to use custom XML: <strong>It may
well be going away very soon</strong>, because, I gather, <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=4835">it infringed
someone's patent</a>. In reaction
to this news, <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2009/12/22/On-Custom-XML">Tim Bray is reiterating his case that rolling your own
XML is a bad
idea</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People like me, who had experience with the extreme difficulty of
doing this kind of customization, the extremely limited number of
places where it made sense, and the high proportion of failure among
people who tried to do it, shouted <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>That<span
class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>s a bug!<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> Given that the number of organizations
that deploy Office is huge, I bet Microsoft can trot out a few
customers who<span class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>ve got good results
with Custom XML. But I also bet that, first of all, the proportion who
try is tiny and, second, that among those who do, few succeed in
getting much business value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm one of these people like Tim and like him, I told you so. Let's
revisit some of this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://ptsefton.com/2009/03/16/opening-up-microsoft.htm">Earlier this year I agreed with Glyn Moody that using custom
XML</a> in a
collaboration between Science Commons and Microsoft was promoting
lock-in to Word 2007 and later versions. If the feature is removed
from future versions then would MS Research like to consider the
<a href="http://ptsefton.com/2009/03/27/more-on-microsoft-collaboration-and-word-processor-interop.htm">suggestion I made in
Marc</a>h
to embed ontological annotations using links. The ontology plugin in
question used the simplest of schemas, so simple that there was
really no need for custom XML at all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have also expressed doubts about the usefulness of a more
complicated plugin that also comes out of Microsoft Research;
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=09c55527-0759-4d6d-ae02-51e90131997e">Article Authoring Add-in for Microsoft Office Word
2007</a>.
This was supposed to let you author documents that were complaint
with the complex NLM document Schema using Word. Again, it would
have worked to lock documents to Word 2007 but I also found it to be
pretty well unusable, and having seen a few of these classes of
application over the years I didn't give it much chance of survival
in the wild. Now, I guess its future is in doubt, and I'd still love
to find the resources to try NLM authoring using the ICE system or a
similar style-based system. I'm assuming that MS won't be under an
injunction to drop styles support any time soon, although they
have<a href="http://ptsefton.com/blog/2006/12/01/dont-bury-styles/">done their best to bury them under the new user interface and
make it less likely that people will use
them</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I counselled my colleagues at Cambridge working on the
<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/chem4word/">Chem4Word</a>plugin
to be cautious, citing lock-in, usability and maintainability. I
wonder if they have heard anything about what might happen to this
tool now? (I still think the best approach would be to use OLE to
embed the chemical editor and simple features like links, fields and
styles for the rest, which would mean that the tool could
interoperate between different word processors including older
versions of Word).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, if Microsoft is going to pull Custom XML out of Word, at least in
the USA, then I was right, it was a trap, it just turned out to have
even nastier teeth than I thought. Now, I'd be really happy to have our
group help any creators open source academic word processor plugins that
have been snared. We're happy to share our experience on how to build
interoperable, simple, robust authoring tools.</p>

<p>last week I headed to Sydney for a couple of days. I visited Intersect,
spent some time with Peter Turner talking about iCat and the DataMINX
project and had a lunchtime meeting with a group of eResearch people at
usyd.</p>
<h1><span id="id1"></span><!--id1--></a>Intersect</h1>
<p>It says on the <a href="http://www.intersect.org.au/">Intersect website</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Intersect is the new peak eResearch body servicing the local research
and innovation sector including all NSW universities and relevant
public and private sector research agencies. With a much needed
concentration of eResearch expertise in the state, Intersect will
coordinate the resources of existing islands of technical capability
among its members and partners to identify, develop and deliver
world-class ICT enabled platforms to drive the next generation of
research and innovation.</p>
<p>Intersect has been established by a consortium of NSW universities,
SIRCA and the NSW State Government, and is constituted as a
not-for-profit company.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Intersect is new and still getting up to speed. Ian Gibson, the CEO took
me and a group of his staff through a presentation about what it is and
where it is going. The bit I liked most was the way they are going to
have embedded eResearch Analyst positions at all the member universities
(although one per facualty or one per department might actually get
things happening). I also liked the fact that they may be able to host
IT services and mind data as well <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span>
I have observed that sometimes in the university sector it seems to be
easier to contract with outside providers than with ICT at one's own
institution, not naming any institutions here of course.</p>
<p>Tuesday afternoon at Intersect I talked about:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://ice-one.usq.edu.au/rep.adfi/www/index.htm">ADFI</a> The
Australian Digital futures institute where we work on eResearch and
eLearning for USQ and external stakeholders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/">ICE</a> <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span>
The Integrated content environment, our scholarly publishing system
set up to create distance education materials in web and print
forms. To illustrate this I pointed to some of our open coursware
<a href="http://ocw.usq.edu.au/">OCW</a>. ICE is now part of our work on
eResearch, see the report from the PKP meeting in December 2008 <a href="http://ptsefton.com/2008/12/11/scholarly-publishing-using-the-integrated-content-environment.htm">ICE
vs
OJS</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://fascinator.usq.edu.au/">The Fascinator</a> - one of the outputs
from our eResearch work. The fascinator is an application with two
modes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A lightweight repository front-end.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An experimental eResearch desktop application.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>See <a href="http://fascinator.usq.edu.au/">The Fascinator</a> site for more
information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In any conversation about publishing scholarly stuff LaTeX will come up,
and it did at Intersect. Yes, ICE supports it, sort of, but no there is
not guarantee that any given LaTeX file can be rendered into HTML <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> it just doesn't work like that. Clare
Sloggett suggested that maybe we could take an ICE-like approach and
support just one way of doing LaTeX <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> like we support just one set of word
processing styles. Why didn't I think of it like that? That's what we
did with word processing after all <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span>
and here I was expecting there to be a magic any-old-TeX to to HTML
converter. (We had sort of discussed a standard 'template' with a group
at USQ and found it too hard, but we'll look that option again, the
discussion has been re-opened with Intersect and at USQ.)</p>
<p>The purpose of my visit to Intersect was to make myself know to the
team, show them what we do and find out just what it is that they are
planning to do. I think there's scope for future collaboration. There
was certainly some interest in ICE.</p>
<h1><span id="id2"></span><!--id2--></a>Peter Turner / <a href="http://www.eresearch.edu.au/data-minx">Data-MINX</a></h1>
<p>I've been talking to Peter Turner for a while about collection, labeling
and routing chemistry data from instruments to lab computers, to
departmental and institutional repositories. This visit I got a demo of
the ICAT software they are planning to use. The demo was a bit limited
partly because it seems to be a bit hard to get hold of test data, does
anyone know of a demo instance we could look at?</p>
<p>Peter and I talked about architectures for synchronizing data around a
set of ICAT instances and allowing data to flow out to repository
services, for which I guess you would use OAI-PMH or Atom Archive, or
both. Some interesting work to be done there.</p>
<h1><span id="id3"></span><!--id3--></a>usyd</h1>
<p>On Wednesday I visited a group convened by <a href="http://twitter.com/jimrhiz">Jim
Richardson</a> at Sydney. We ran through the
same sort of stuff as with Intersect, only faster, and I talked about
the new <a href="http://www.caul.edu.au/cairss/">CAIRSS service</a> that we will be
running at USQ for the Council of Australian University Librarians.
CAIRSS is new enough that I was unable to talk about it except in the
most general terms, like that it has two staff who will be supporting
the repository community, one a repository manager, Kate Watson from USC
and the other a technincal officer Tim McCallum from USQ. I know these
two will be helpful, we're sorting out with the steering committee and
the community just what form the help will take.</p>
<p>Of particular interest to this group was the new desktop version of The
Fascinator <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> we're keen to keep
getting requirements and comment from Jim Richardson and Rowan Brownlee.
We didn't quite have taxonomy support ready to demo but as soon as we do
we will put up a screencast and seek input from one and all.
Gratifyingly, Jim endorsed our open approach of twittering, blogging,
screencasting and hosting an open source code base.</p>
<p>Finally I caught up Steven Hayes at the Archeological computing lab. He
showed me
<a href="http://acl.arts.usyd.edu.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=179&amp;Itemid=208">Heurist</a>
<span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> a bookmark manager that turned
into a full-on semantic-web eResearch environment. I hope that's a
reasonable way to describe it.</p>
<p>Of particular interest to our work was the way Heurist has been used to
manage resources about the ANZAC campaign at Gallipoli, including
details like an onotology of army ranks which could be re-used for the
work we are doing with the Public Memory Research Centre
(<a href="http://www.usq.edu.au/research/centres/pmrc.htm">PMRC</a>) at USQ, with
Leonie Jones.</p>
<p>Steven offered to put up a Heurist instance we can try out, and was
encouraging about our work on the Desktop Fascinator picking up the
goals of the Field Helper application that came out of that group.
Heurist could definitely be one of the places to which data can be
routed from the desktop.</p>

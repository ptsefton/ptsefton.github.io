<p>A few weeks ago, I felt there was something in the air to do with
desktop tools for eResearch. We went with that in the form of The
Desktop Fascinator and have been enjoying a productive conversation with
others in the, um, what's the word for the twitter-o-blog-o-sphere?</p>
<p>This week I feel the time is right to look with fresh eyes at something
we have been over and over in the <a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/">ICE</a> project;
the place of HTML in scholarly publishing. There have been a couple of
things happen recently that made me look at the issues in a new light.</p>
<p>I'm going to propose here an application profile of HTML for scholarly
works, with some conventions for representing an article or chapter as a
single web page, with referenceable paragraphs, semantic web via a
linked data approach, simple inline citations and protocols for
representing quotes, examples etc; <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>Scholarly HTML<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>. This is only a working title and it's a
bad one because if you search for that you get a lot of hits for
filenames; <code>scholarly.html</code>.</p>
<p>I am sure I am not the first to think of some of these ideas <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> any pointers to prior-art would be
appreciated.</p>
<h1><span id="id1"></span><!--id1--></a>Background</h1>
<p>Lets start with Rick Jelliffe, who <a href="http://broadcast.oreilly.com/2009/03/master-blaster.html">talked about Dennis Hamilton's
notion of standards floors and
ceilings</a> in
relation to my relentless ranting about HTML:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dennis Hamilton over at the ODF TC made an interesting point recently
about <em>floors</em> and <em>ceilings</em> and interoperability: both are needed. I
think one of Peter's main points is this issue of having an adequate
floor: that HTML should be this floor but its support by desktop
vendors in their applications continues to be ratty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like this idea of a floor and that's where I think we need to work if
we want to mobilise the <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/commonknowledge/2009/03/lions_tigers_and_crowds.php">micro-crowds that John Wilbanks talks
about</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The difference is that .005% of all web users gets us Wikipedia. .005%
of geneticists gets us a table at T.G.I. Friday's. My point was that
the math breaks down for crowds and science.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we further break that down into 50% of the geneticists using LaTeX
and 30% using Word 2007 and 20% using something else (I made this up
what do geneticists use to write their papers and theses?) then we have
made an even smaller pool of users who will be able to tag their work
with terms from genetic ontologies. I'm talking about using the Word
2007 add-in that John Wilbanks has been working on with Microsoft. But
what if we worked out a way to do semantic-web-scholarly publishing in
HTML that would be useful for all of the people at the table at T.G.I.
Friday's, whatever that is.</p>
<p>Then we have Mark Pilgrim doing his <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2009/03/27/dive-into-history-2009-edition">update to Dive into Python in
HTML</a>.
Bye bye DocBook. Hello HTML.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anyway, I now realize that there were some hidden assumptions behind
my design decisions in 2000. Some of those assumptions turned out to
be wrong, or at least not-completely-right. Sure, a lot of people
downloaded DiP, but it still pales in comparison to the number of
visitors I got from search traffic. In 2000, I fretted about my <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>home page<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> and my <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>navigation aids.<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> Nobody cares about any of that
anymore, and I have nine years of access logs to prove it.</p>
<p>So, I am writing DiP3 in pure HTML and, modulo some <a href="http://diveintopython3.org/about.html">lossless
minimizations</a>, publishing
exactly what I write. This makes the proofreading feedback cycle
faster <span class="spCh spChx2014">—</span> instead of <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>building<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> the HTML output, I just hit <code>Ctrl-R</code>.
I expected it to make some things more complicated, but they turn out
not to matter very much.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's no discussion in this post about what the publisher will do to
make it into a book, but whatever toolchains these people use should be
able to be adapted to HTML, particularly if there was a profile which
people could use to say 'this blockquote is an example'. There are other
bits which I'm sure could be cleaned up too with a bit of jQuery <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> like automated numbering of examples or
headings.</p>
<p>I am guessing Mark Pilgrim used emacs to write, sorry '<a href="http://diveintopython3.org/about.html">lovingly hand
craft</a>' this thing, but with the
set of guidelines he gives for how to format stuff you could do it in a
wiki, or WordPress or you guessed it, <a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/">ICE</a>. And
as for cruft in the HTML, well provided people use the key things we
care about, like headings, and block-quotes and so on then we can strip
out the rest.</p>
<p>ICE makes PDF and HTML <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> but for the
purposes of a new scholarly publishing model we can set PDF aside as
something we will generate later on, from whatever is most convenient.
The HTML is the bit that matters now.</p>
<p>This reminded me of Peter Murray Rust <a href="http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/murrayrust/?p=1212">on
PDF</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why should documents have page numbers? why should be have two columns
per page. Because the publishers force it on us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And what Tim Bray said, ages and ages ago before he went quiet on this
whole topic. Here's <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2004/11/30.html">Jon Udell on Tim
Bray</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Musing on the European Commission's findings, Tim Bray wondered if
maybe XHTML had gotten short shrift:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They considered, and rejected, XHTML as a standard office document
format. I think that it can do most things you need in a modern
office document and has remarkably few real drawbacks.
[<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/06/17/CustomSchemas">ongoing</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not ready to go along with the other conclusion he reaches in that
posting -- that custom schemas are a red herring. But I agree that
XHTML is more valuable than most people think. For the vast majority
of useful documents, it can have as much structure as we need, and for
the rest it can be extended internally with namespaced inclusions. But
the real power arises from its hypertextual nature. For me,
increasingly, <strong>there is no office, and there is</strong> <strong>no desktop, there
is only a network of linked documents</strong>. A successful open document
format will have to be supremely well-adapted to that environment, as
XHTML is.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1><span id="id3"></span><!--id3--></a>Rules of the game</h1>
<p>As we're talking about laying a floor here rather than swinging from the
ceiling I want stuff that could be authored in a generic HTML editor, or
in any other tool that can produce HTML, like a wiki, or Moodle, or
WordPress, or using something like Google docs. So that means really
simple mechanisms and microformats and nothing that depends on anything
that costs money to use.</p>
<p>What I'm thinking is, everyone can do links so lets go crazy with links.</p>
<p>Unfortunately even <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-primer/">RDFa</a> is
out, as you can't do it via a word processor or a typical WYSIWYG HTML
editing tool. I reckon adding the rel attribute it too hard but what
would make it easy for everyone is if the CC people set up a has-licence
page where the rel is part of the endpoint. So this example from the
RDFa primer:</p>
<pre><code>All content on this site is licensed under

&lt;a rel=&quot;license&quot; href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/&quot;&gt;

    a Creative Commons License

&lt;/a&gt;.
</code></pre>
<p>Becomes this, where you bundle the predicate and the object together and
link to them from the subject.</p>
<pre><code>All content on this site is licensed under

&lt;a  href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/haslicense&quot;&gt;

    a Creative Commons License

&lt;/a&gt;.
</code></pre>
<p>The trick is not to link to an identifier for the license but an
identifier for license-plus-verb.</p>
<h1><span id="id4"></span><!--id4--></a>What it should be like</h1>
<p>Here's a list of stuff the Scholarly HTML should do, off the top of my
head. Argue with me:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Headings. Documents should definitely have headings.</strong> They don't
need nested sections because the headings are enough for a machine
to work out the nesting. If a journal/discipline really really must
have some fixed structure you could validate that the first heading
element contains the text 'Introduction' and so on.</p>
<p>The page should have title, and the title should be put in the top
of the document in an <code>&lt;h1 class=”title”&gt;</code> element. Thereafter the
next heading should be a plain-old <code>h1</code>. If naughty users jump from
<code>h1</code> to <code>h3</code> we'll just normalize that back to <code>h2</code> later on.</p>
<p>If you really really need more formal structure then how about
putting an empty link in the heading to a web page for something
like an NLM section, meaning this 'h1' is the same as that NLM
element. But do you really need all those elements if the paper <em>is</em>
the HTML?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Protocols for representing things like examples</strong>. Mark Pilgrim
says he uses blockquotes, but there should be some class that lets
you tell an example of your own from a quotation. We don't need a
standards committee yet, we need some examples.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Metadata, using a linked data approach</strong> (which I am going to
describe in another post, but which I have <a href="http://ptsefton.com/2009/03/17/more-on-microsoft-word-and-non-interoperable-standards-compliance.htm">touched on
before</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What if my local ePrints repostiory had a page for me-as-author.
It might look like
<a href="http://eprints.usw.edu.au/authors/PeterMacolmSefton">http://eprints.usw.edu.au/authors/PeterMacolmSefton</a> and resolve
to a page that describes me and the works that are attributed to
me with a note there that says <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>if you want to indicate that this
person is an author of a paper, link their name as it appears on
the work to this page<span class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>. That
is way simpler to implement than the stuff we talked about in our
paper on <a href="http://www.dspace.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/206423">embedding semantics in word processing
documents</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The journal itself could provide is-author pages for those who don't
have them yet as they collect data about the authors in their
journal websites anyway. We'll work out a way to relate the
is-author pages together later. We have to start somewhere.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Links from terms mentioned in the text to <strong>ontologies</strong> that
describe them. This is going to be kind of silly if all we do is
link the same term to the same ontology over and over again like the
<a href="http://ptsefton.com/2009/03/27/more-on-microsoft-collaboration-and-word-processor-interop.htm">discussion about 'Potter syndrome' we had here last
week</a>
as that string unlikely to be ambiguous, but could be useful if you
link different strings of text to the same ontology. Like, say you
could link <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>distinctive
lightning shaped scarring on forehead<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> to Potter syndrome.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Linkable paragraphs</strong> <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> via a
mechanism like <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/05/31/PurpleAgain">Tim Bray's purple
pilcrows</a>.
These could be used to cite the paper but could also be key to
<a href="file:///home/sefton/Documents/%20http://ptsefton.com/2009/01/05/potential-projects-1-a-general-purpose-document-annotation-system.htm">stand-off annotation/discussion
services</a>.
This does not need to be done by the author <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> we can make scripts that do that
when the page crosses the curation boundary. ICE has cute tricks it
uses to provide Ids for pages that are partly based on their content
so we can tell when a paragraph has changed, but keep it around if
someone has commented on it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dead simple reference management</strong> via links to trusted sources.
In many disciplines the manuscript should be able to do what
Peter-Muray Rust said and just use a DOI <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> the publisher can be responsible to
fetching the metadata and making a bibliography. How about you let
the user choose the referencing style and select it on the fly using
Zotero's growing CSL library? Or skip that altogether an let readers
import the references into their own libraries.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Illustrations? I don't know, that's one we will have to work through.
Maths likewise.</p>
<p>Out of scope for now is how ORE would be used to describe a
data-supported paper with the text and all its associated images and
data files as an aggregation. This is partly because there are very few
end-user tools that would let someone package a document in this way but
I think they will start to appear. There's one for WordPress for
example.</p>
<p>Beyond just putting stuff on the web, I think this approach would make
it simpler to write lots of the tools that are going to machine-read the
semantic-scholarly web; make them all work on Scholarly HTML rather than
trying to deal with several different upstream formats.</p>

<p>This is a report on my trip to the UK in February 2009. It will start
life as a blog post, which will then form the basis for a report to
<a href="http://www.usq.edu.au/adfi">ADFI</a>.</p>
<p>The main event was the Developer Happiness Days conference, but I also
had meetings with four institutions: <a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/">UKOLN</a> @
University of Bath, Southampton, King's College London and Birkbeck
college in London.</p>
<h1><span id="id1"></span><!--id1--></a>Dev8D</h1>
<p>First up the event. It's a bit hard to describe the event that David
Flanders and Ben O'Steen and team put on and called The Developer
Happiness days but Julian Cheal has an <a href="http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue58/jisc-dev8d-rpt/">article in
Ariadne</a>.</p>
<p>Ben O'Steen gives a good run down of <a href="http://oxfordrepo.blogspot.com/2009/02/developer-happiness-days-why-happyness.html">Why happiness is
important</a>.
His summary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To foster innovation and to allow for creativity in software
development:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Having <strong>play</strong> space is <strong>important</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being <strong>vague</strong> with aims and <strong>flexible</strong> with outcomes is not a
bad thing and is <strong>vital</strong> for unexpected things to develop -
<em>e.g. A project's outcomes should be under continual
re-negotiation as a general rule, not as the exception.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Encouraging</strong> and <strong>enabling</strong> free and easy communication is
<strong>crucial</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be aware of what drives people to do what they do. Push all
feedback to be <strong>as disproportionate as possible</strong>, allowing both
developers and users to benefit, with only putting a relatively
trivial amount of input in (this pattern affects web UIs,
development cycles, team interaction, etc)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Choose useful highscores</strong> and be prepared to ditch them or
change them if they are no longer <strong>fun and motivational</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://oxfordrepo.blogspot.com/2009/02/developer-happiness-days-why-happyness.html">http://oxfordrepo.blogspot.com/2009/02/developer-happiness-days-why-happyness.html</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For me the Twitter side-channel that went along with the event was a
revelation <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> it added a new
dimension I have not experienced before <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> you could peek into other sessions,
organise dinner, and so on, even measure overall happiness. Ben <a href="http://oxfordrepo.blogspot.com/2009/02/tracking-conferences-at-dev8d-with.html">looked
at how twitter was used during the
conference</a>
along with Flickr photo sharing via the tag dev8d. You can see that the
chatter went on after the conference with a Twitter search for
<a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23dev8d">#dev8d</a>.</p>
<p>My contribution:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I kicked off the Python for newbies day with some simple unit
testing and later did a lightning talk on XSLT, both described
briefly
<a href="http://ptsefton.com/2009/02/12/the-path-to-developer-happiness-unit-testing-in-python-xslt.htm">here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I did a talk entitled Getting beyond the PDF. I wrote that up
<a href="http://ptsefton.com/2009/02/12/the-path-to-developer-happiness-unit-testing-in-python-xslt.htm">too</a>.
There were only a few people in the room, but it was videoed, picked
up on the blogosphere and evidently seen by people who were not in
the room.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I accidentally entered the Developer Decathlon competition with team
<a name=":29"><!--:29--></a>Three Lazy Geeks. More on that below.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I wasn't intending to enter the competition<span
class="footnote"><a href="#ftn1">1</a><span class="footnote-text"></span></span>
but I wandered into the room where they had real lecturers talking about
what software services they'd like to see and met <a href="http://www.rvc.ac.uk/AboutUS/Staff/nshort/index.cfm">Nick Short of the
Royal Veterinary College,
London</a>.</p>
<p>Paul Walk <a href="http://blog.paulwalk.net/2009/02/13/making-developers-happy/">describes this
process</a>
whereby users were invited to engage with developers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the things which stood out at dev8D was the way in which users
(or <a href="http://code.google.com/p/developerhappinessdays/wiki/UberUsers"><span
class="Emphasis">UberUsers</span></a></p>
<p><span class="Strong_20_Emphasis">important, non-obvious</span>) were
invited to engage with developers. There<span
class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>s an distinction here. Users were
invited to come into the developers<span
class="spCh spChx2019">’</span> environment. Brave users, you might
say! Normally, developers are invited into the users<span
class="spCh spChx2019">’</span> environment<span
class="spCh spChx2026">…</span>. for just long enough to explain to
them what the users require. Users would often rather not have to deal
with developers all that much. To step into an environment of happy,
busy developers must have been an eye-opening experience for those
users who were brave enough, and open-minded enough to try it.
Although I wasn<span class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>t on the <span
class="spCh spChx2018">‘</span>dragons den<span
class="spCh spChx2019">’</span> panel looking at the prototypes being
developed in the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/developerhappinessdays/wiki/DeveloperDecathlon"><span class="Emphasis">Developer
Decathlon</span></a>,
it was remarked to me several times that the quality of submissions
was better than in previous events - and that this was attributed to
the fact that users had been involved in the prototyping process.
I<span class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>m one of the judges who<span
class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>ll be marking these submissions and
I<span class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>m really looking forward to
seeing what was produced.</p>

<p>Nick Short was after something to help him prepare presentations with
images and video. He said he wanted to do it an hour before the lecture,
but I think that was an exaggeration. On one level it sounded like what
he and his colleagues really needed was some training to help them deal
with unfamiliar media, but true to form I managed to come up with an
idea for a software solution that involved several moving parts. Why not
tag resources in del.icio.us then harvest them into a powerpoint later,
I wondered?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.miaridge.com/">Mia Ridge</a>, a web and database
analyst/programmer who works at the Science Museum in London was
interested in the idea. She recruited Ian Ibbotson, occupation 'geek'
according to his <a href="http://k-int.blogspot.com/">work blog</a>, making what
was eventually called team Three Lazy geeks. As we worked through the
original idea it became clear that 'just tag in delicious' is an
oversimplification, and we ended up with a intermediary web service that
would know about your lectures and help you tag resources.</p>
<p>Mia put the<a href="http://miaridge.com/projects/lazylecturer/about.php">Three Lazy Geeks submission up on her
site</a>. The key
thing you have to submit is a screencast. I did that out-of-sync
screencast late at night (or was it early in the morning?) in my hotel
room on the underpowered Dell Mini 9. That was the only take, and as Mia
points out I didn't even mention that Nick's a vet. Here's a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHOPTvwhAt0">louder
version</a> of the screencast.
I will post what I learned about screencasting in Ubuntu Linux soon.</p>
<h1><span id="id2"></span><!--id2--></a>Other visits</h1>
<h2><span id="id3"></span><!--id3--></a>UKOLN, Bath</h2>
<p>This visit was motivated by <a href="http:/%0A/ptsefton.com/2009/01/06/potential-projects-2-integrating-ice-with-the-open-journal-systems.htm">discussions with Chris Rusbridge about The
Internations Journal of Digital
Curation</a>.</p>
<p>Chris didn't make it down from Edinburgh, so I met with <a href="http://blog.paulwalk.net/">Paul
Walk</a> and <a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/">Brian
Kelly</a> and colleagues. I gave a demonstration
of ICE with the emphasis on how it might be used for research
publications (ie for journals and the like).</p>
<p>So far there are no actions arising from this meeting apart from us
providing Brian with a test account in ICE just as soon as the OpenId
login is working (this week I hope), but there were hints that ICE might
be useful for some of what UKOLN do, in due course (and if it works as
expected for them, of course). We'd be happy to help out if UKOLN would
like to trial ICE.</p>
<h2><span id="id4"></span><!--id4--></a>Southampton</h2>
<p>I met with Mr ePrints Les Carr and Simon Coles who works in Chemistry,
and a couple of their colleagues. Simon says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Andrew Milsted is nearing the writing up stages of his PhD and was
responsible for the Blog Lab Notebook and eCrystals data repository on
top of Eprints ( <a href="http://chemtools.chem.soton.ac.uk/projects/blog/">http://chemtools.chem.soton.ac.uk/projects/blog/</a>  
&amp;   <a href="http://wiki.ecrystals.chem.soton.ac.uk/index.php/Main_Page">http://wiki.ecrystals.chem.soton.ac.uk/index.php/Main_Page</a> ).<br>
<br>
Mark Borkum is a first year PhD student charged with learning from our
experiences with the Blog and Data repositories and designing, ground
up, a generic system that will accommodate those requirements. Mark
has worked on myExperiment ( <a href="http://www.myexperiment.org/">http://www.myexperiment.org/</a> ) and
StOReLink (
<a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/digitalrepositories2007/storelink.aspx">http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/digitalrepositories2007/storelink.aspx</a>
) and is now working on oreChem (
<a href="http://www.openarchives.org/oreChem/">http://www.openarchives.org/oreChem/</a> ).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was a pretty long day with wide-ranging conversation about eResearch
services and repositories. Amongst other things we talked about:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The collaborative spaces that Simon's team are creating for chemists
based on a blog system which is far more than a blog.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How ICE might complement some of their existing and planned work in
this area. I gave a demo of the work we have done in</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With Les, how ePrints is going in a business sense. Watch this
space, for various reasons I can't talk about some of the ideas we
tossed around, yet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An idea I have for bringing the the semantic web in reach for
systems like ePrints and other repositories and for 'ordinary' word
users by encapsulating predicate and object into a single URI that
people can 'just link'. More on that in another post.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="id6"></span><!--id6--></a>Kings College</h2>
<p>I have been talking with Mark Hedges Deputy Director of the Centre for
e-Research for King's College London for some time. We met with a some
of his colleagues (Tobias Blanke, Vikas Deora and Omar Radwan) to give a
demo of the work we've been doing on
I<a href="http://development.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/digitalrepositories2007/theoremice.aspx">CE-TheOREM</a>,
which turned into a robust discussion about the relative merits of word
processing a la ICE, LaTeX and XML. Vikas extolled the virtues of LaTeX
for thesis writing. I'm happy for people to use whichever tools they
like, but I can't see LaTeX rolling out into disciplines which it has
not already conquered without a lot of evangelistic work. If we could
find a generic LaTeX to HTML converter that worked we'd plug that into
ICE in a second.</p>
<p>Mark is interested in applying the approach we took with ICE-TheOREM in
the humanities, and possibly one or more of the sciences with a view to
a more substantial trial in the future. We discussed various kinds of
data/document integration including things like geocoded archaeological
data and the biosciences. We will assist from our end in getting a trial
ICE installation and/or accounts going.</p>
<h2><span id="id7"></span><!--id7--></a>Birkbeck</h2>
<p>I met with a very worn out post-dev8D David Flanders along with Mark,
and got a bit of an insight into how JISC are seeing the process of
getting their innovation projects into production. David has put a fair
bit of thought into the kinds of team members you need to have around
your developers to get code from the lab into production. I won't
attempt to reproduce his model here, hope he publishes it soon for
comment.</p>
<p>David and team have also been looking at Google docs in an academic
environment. Caroline Bell and Sarah Sherman joined us to talk about how
users have taken to the Google tools. We're exploring the possibility of
a collaboration where my team would look at how to design templates for
Google docs that give the best prospects for document re-use. I see this
as the first step for us in the inevitable ICE to Google Docs adapter we
will have to write as the service gains users.</p>

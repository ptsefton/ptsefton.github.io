<p>Glyn Moody has posted <a href="http://opendotdotdot.blogspot.com/2009/03/open-science-closed-source.html">Open Science, Closed
Source</a>
in which he takes John Wilbanks to task for collaborating with Microsoft
and effectively perpetuating Microsoft's stranglehold on word
processing.</p>
<p>I agree with this analysis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Working with Microsoft on open source plugins might seem innocent
enough, but it's really just entrenching Microsoft's power yet further
in the scientific community, weakening openness in general - which
means, ultimately, undermining all the other excellent work of the
Science Commons.</p>
<p>It would have been far better to work with OpenOffice.org to produce
similar plugins, making the free office suite even more attractive,
and thus giving scientists yet another reason to go truly open, with
all the attendant benefits, rather than making do with a hobbled,
faux-openness, as here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking at the <a href="http://ucsdbiolit.codeplex.com/">example here</a> and
r<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/exscientia/archive/2009/03/11/ontology-add-in-for-word-2007.aspx">eading Pablo's
Blog</a>
I share Glyn Moody's concern. They show a chunk of custom XML which gets
embedded in a word document. This custom XML is an insidious trick in my
opinion as it makes documents non-interoperable. As soon as you use
custom XML via Word 2007 you are guaranteeing that information will be
lost when you share documents with OpenOffice.org users and potentially
users of earlier versions of Word.</p>
<p>For something like an ontology this is completely unnecessary <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> all you should need to do is <em>link</em> to a
web endpoint for a term to associate a word in your text with an
ontology. This is similar to something I discussed with <a href="http://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Frepositoryman.blogspot.com%2F&amp;ei=27S9Sc29J8zPkAXNj5iXCA&amp;usg=AFQjCNHxpoXJAXJuq-G44eCMcW-3gFGJGQ&amp;sig2=o_uJBz5FrjmLmD_q1qVzxA">Les
Carr;</a>
a repository like ePrints could provide endpoint pages for links that
when you link to them say <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>Les Carr
is an author of the document that links to this<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>, that is, you bundle the predicate and
the object together in an RDF assertion. All the users have to do is
link to a page. That is a nanoformat that will work with <em>any</em> web
capable tool on the planet, including wikis and text editors. Am I
missing something here about how this could work at the file format
level?</p>
<p>On top of the interoperability it might be really useful to have some
custom code embedded in Word to help people <em>apply</em> these links, and if
Microsoft are involved in that and the stuff is available open source
then that's fine <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> it might help
them sell a few more copies of Office, but on the basis of <strong>ease of
use</strong> not <strong>impossibility of escape</strong>. Sun could even be involved in a
similar effort for OpenOffice.org or Star Office if they wanted <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> they just don't seem to care too much
about eResearch or <a href="http://ptsefton.com/2009/02/05/openofficeorg-is-bad-for-the-planet.htm">getting their word processor to talk to the
web</a>
at the moment.</p>
<p><a href="http://ptsefton.com/2008/08/05/another-look-at-the-article-authoring-add-in-for-microsoft-office-word-2007.htm">Another example I have been vocal
about</a>
is the <a href="http://opendotdotdot.blogspot.com/2009/03/open-science-closed-source.html">Microsoft NLM XML
Add-in</a>.
If it works to allow ordinary word users to create XML to the NLM schema
then it too will be one of these open-yet-closed Microsoft systems. Open
source, yes, based on an open format, yes<span
class="footnote"><a href="#ftn0">1</a><span class="footnote-text"> Glyn Moody is
adamant that the Office format is a psuedo standard that has harmed the
ISO Standards forum. That may be so. Me, I welcome having the format
well specified.</span></span>, in fact in this case two open formats yet
it will only run in Word 2007 on the Windows platform and the source
documents you create with it will only work on that platform. It may be
useful but it will also continue the Microsoft stranglehold that Glyn
Moody was complaining about. I just don't buy the argument that they
can't implement the same thing using styles and have something that
would at least interoperate with other word processors (including other
Word versions).</p>
<p>I think we are seeing a new kind of format lock-in; a kind of
monopolistic wolf in open-standards lambskin. I'm not saying that this
is deliberate, at least not at Microsoft Research where the staff seem
to be well meaning, open, communicative and friendly. They keep talking
to me even though I keep ranting at them, at least so far.</p>
<p>I warned Jim Downing from Cambridge about this kind of lock-in when I
was over in Cambridge last year and he has taken up this issue with the
Microsoft developers working on Chem4Word as <a href="http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/murrayrust/?p=1212">discussed here by Peter
Murray-Rust</a>, who
also offers <a href="http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/murrayrust/?p=1234">this in defense of the work they're
doing</a> there and <a href="http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/murrayrust/?p=1267">a
follow-up</a>.</p>
<p>In conclusion I offer this: I would consider getting our team working
with Microsoft (actually I'm actively courting them as they are doing
some good work in the eResearch space) but it would be on the basis
that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The product (eg a document) of the code must be interoperable with
open software. In our case this means Word must produce stuff that
can be used in and round tripped with OpenOffice.org and with
earlier versions, and Mac versions of Microsoft's products. (This is
not as simple as it could be when we have to deal with stuff like
Sun refusing to implement import and preservation for data stored in
Word fields as used by applications like EndNote.)</p>
<p>The <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/exscientia/archive/2008/07/28/release-candidate-for-article-authoring-add-in.aspx">NLM
add-in</a>
is an odd one here, as on one level it does qualify in that it spits
out XML, but the intent is to create Word-only authoring so that
rules it out <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> not that we have
been asked to work on that project other than to comment, I am
merely using it as an example.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The code must be open source and as portable as possible. Of course
if it is interface code it will only work with Microsoft's
toll-access software but at least others can read the code and
re-implement elsewhere. If it's not interface code then it must be
written in a portable language and/or framework.</p>
</li>
</ul>

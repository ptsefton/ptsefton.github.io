More on Microsoft Collaboration and word processor interop

<p>It's not like I'm ever going to get the last word on this unless I turn
off the comments but I would like to wrap up the discussion that's <a href="http://ptsefton.com/2009/03/17/more-on-microsoft-word-and-non-interoperable-standards-compliance.htm">gone
on
here</a>
about word processor interoperablity and format support in various word
processors, which was sparked by <a href="http://opendotdotdot.blogspot.com/2009/03/open-science-closed-source.html">Glyn Moody's
complaint</a>
that the Science Commons people were working with Microsoft and
perpetuating their monopoly on word processing and move it onto
specifics about what we can do for scholarly communications.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://broadcast.oreilly.com/2009/03/master-blaster.html">Rick Jelliffe
says</a> I get
good quality comments here. (Rick has taken the time to collate some of
my more direct statements together into a page which he called <a href="http://broadcast.oreilly.com/2009/03/master-blaster.html">Master
Blaster</a>. Did
I say all that? Lucky the only vendor responding much is Microsoft and
they are used to much worse than I dish out.)</p>
<p>I want to just follow up on a couple of those comments an clearly pose
the questions I have been asking all along.</p>
<p>Rick points out that I was wrong to suggest that ODF doesn't have a
custom XML feature. He's right, and it's much worse than the OOXML one,
because OpenOffice.org (which is really the only thing that supports
most of the standard) doesn't support it. But I have never seen any kind
of proposal that anyone would <em>use</em> such a silly feature so I have been
ignoring it.</p>
<p>Rick also
<a href="http://ptsefton.com/2009/03/16/opening-up-microsoft.htm/comment-page-1#comment-133">says</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The aspect of this is that it seems a bit strange to criticize a
general feature that is specifically designed to allow value-added
documents to participate in custom toolchains that they impair
interoperability. It is like saying that the pen impedes
interoperability because it may be used to write in Mongolian, which
few people can read.</p>
<p>Interoperability is not the be-all and end-all of qualities for a
document format. Customizability and extensibility are useful things,
in their place.</p>
<p>So it seems to me that the question should be whether the customXML
features are useful or appropriate or optimal for a certain case (or
class of cases), rather than blanket statements. I think I am allowed
to have different use cases, and therefore features, to you, aren<span
class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>t I?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes exactly. I thought that I was making it clear that I am talking
about use cases like the Ontology plugin work, i<em>n the context of
academia</em>. If that was not clear I will state it now, I agree with Rick,
and it is none of my business what you do with Microsoft technology in
the privacy of your own enterprises. I just go on about interoperability
because it's important to me and my colleagues for various reasons not
the least of which is that we work in a heterogeneous software
environment. I think that was at the root of Glyn Moody's original rant,
too.</p>
<p>Ian Easson patiently
<a href="http://ptsefton.com/2009/03/17/more-on-microsoft-word-and-non-interoperable-standards-compliance.htm/comment-page-1#comment-130">explained</a>
what happened when he tried out the Word 2007 ontology plugin which
sparked this whole thing. I won't quote the whole thing here but the
essence is that if you use the Add-in, save your document edit in Word
2003, as long as it has been retrofitted with the <code>docx</code> reader then
your information may or may not survive editing.</p>
<p>Specifically using Ian's example if he changes Potter syndrome (linked
to an ontology) to <em>blah blah</em> then the custom XML goes away. But why
should it it? What if <em>blah blah</em> were a synonym of Potter syndrome?</p>
<p>Ian has confirmed what I said in the first place which is that the
custom XML may or may not survive the round trip. Anyway, if you save to
<code>.doc</code> to share with other users be they Word 2003 or Writer users the
information is lost.</p>
<p>And we have
<a href="http://ptsefton.com/2009/03/17/more-on-microsoft-word-and-non-interoperable-standards-compliance.htm/comment-page-1#comment-127">this</a>
from Microsoft's Doug Mahugh:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Peter, I<span class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>m with Ian on the fact
that IS29500<span class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>s custom XML support
is every bit as well-defined as OLE embedding is. I agree with your
point that it<span class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>s messy for two
different editing applications to round-trip documents with custom
markup in them, especially if the document is edited in both apps, but
that<span class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>s not the typical use case
I<span class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>ve seen in custom XML scenarios.
<strong>The tagging of content is usually done immediately before some type
of automated processing by a non-desktop app, so the issue of what an
editor should do with that markup doesn<span
class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>t come up very often.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>See the last sentence there, which I emphasised? Here's Doug talking
about the kind of situation where this kind of XML work makes sense
<span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> but I think this is at odds with a
plugin which might be used by a group of collaborators working on a
paper as I would expect to get with the plugins coming out of Microsoft
Research.</p>
<p>So I'm going to ask the same question I asked before. <strong>Why couldn't</strong>
<a href="http://ucsdbiolit.codeplex.com/"><strong>the ontology add-in</strong></a> <strong>(which is a
good idea, don't get me wrong) store data using the simplest most robust
method possible; using a link?</strong></p>
<p>The Human Diseases ontology cited by Ian doesn't seem to be
web-referenceable but I found one that is. Geonames.org provides a
linked-data endpoint for
<a href="http://www.geonames.org/2146268/toowoomba.html">Toowoomba</a>. See what I
did there? I linked to it. And look how you can <a href="http://sws.geonames.org/2146268/about.rdf">get
RDF</a>. That will survive round
tripping between Word and OpenOffice.org, saving as HTML, saving as
.doc, sending to a publisher, and it's perfectly usable without an
add-in. Could someone explain to me why you would need to use custom XML
here given the simplicity, robustness and interoperability of the
alternative?</p>
<p>And I'll say one more time that this is not incompatible with the idea
of having an in-application Add-in to help you find locations or
diseases (Toowoomba is considered by some to be both) and link them. If
Word has this, then Microsoft might sell a few copies or prevent a few
researchers from moving to OpenOffice.org by providing a better tool,
not by locking them in no matter whose 'fault' that is.</p>

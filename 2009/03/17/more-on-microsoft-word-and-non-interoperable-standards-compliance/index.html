<p>Glyn Moody was
<a href="http://opendotdotdot.blogspot.com/2009/03/opening-minds-about-closed-source.html">pleased</a>
with <a href="http://ptsefton.com/2009/03/16/opening-up-microsoft.htm">my
response</a> to
his
<a href="http://opendotdotdot.blogspot.com/2009/03/open-science-closed-source.html">rant</a>
on Microsoft Collaboration.</p>
<p>Others were less so. And Jim Downing would like me to expand on what I
think might be good ways to do interoperable plugins. I'll start by
dealing with the comments, which leads to looking at how plugins like
Chem4Word might work. I don't have time right now to do a lot of
background research for this post so I will pose a few questions and I'd
appreciate more feedback.</p>
<p>First up, Ian Easson has some advice for me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The essence of your objection to custom XML embedded in OOXML files is
this:</p>
<p><span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>This custom XML is an insidious
trick in my opinion as it makes documents non-interoperable. As soon
as you use custom XML via Word 2007 you are guaranteeing that
information will be lost when you share documents with OpenOffice.org
users and potentially users of earlier versions of Word.<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span></p>
<p>You should learn more about something before you make a big fuss about
it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks Ian, I'll try to fit that into my busy schedule.</p>
<p>He then says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, it is entirely a question of the *consumer* of this
information as to whether the custom XML gets lost. In the case of
older versions of Word using Microsoft<span
class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>s free add-on to read and write OOXML,
THE INFORMATION IS NOT LOST. The <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>write<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> part of the add-in preserves any such
information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right. The information is written out into OOXML then when you open it
in an earlier version of Word you can't see it. I tried this with the
NLM plugin and as far as I recall there was no structure apparent if you
open the file in an earlier version of Word. The result is that if you
try to edit the document you break the structure at which point THE
INFORMATION IS LOST.</p>
<p>And then there's OpenOffice.org:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As for Open Office not preserving it (if it does so, I don<span
class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>t know), the fault is with OpenOfiice,
not with Word or with the OOXML ability to embed custom XML. Talk to
them about it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm pretty sure that the official Sun OOo build can read OOXML but not
write it (thanks Sun for your commitment to interoperability) and
whether it discards the XML is irrelevant in that case as there is no
equivalent mechanism in the Open Document Format. There is another
version of OOo with some code contributed by (I think) Novell <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> which may preserve the XML but the
situation is the same as with earlier versions of Word <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> the XML is unlikely to survive editing
of the document.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As for the general argument that the custom XML in IS29500 documents
acts to reduce interoperability, you are simply wrong, for two
reasons:</p>
<p>1) Applications that consume and generate IS29500 (OOXML) documents, if
properly written, are supposed to ignore (not strip out) any such custom
XML if they don<span class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>t understand it. So,
the custom XML is totally invisible to such applications.<br />
2) For applications that are specially written to consume or generate a
specific variety of custom XML, the ability to have such XML embedded in
ordinary office documents acts greatly to IMPROVE their specific kind of
interoperability.</p>
<p>So, the end result is: improved interoperability, with no downside.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I disagree. This doesn't promote interoperability in practice, as I
noted above, it promotes sales of Word 2007. I think this 'feature' is a
trick.</p>
<p>What <strong>does</strong> promote interoperability is the approach that Microsoft
itself used to use with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Linking_and_Embedding">OLE
embedding</a>.
We saw this in action with Peter Murray-Rust last year. He brought a
Word document with embedded ChemDraw chemistry pictures in it. Guess
what? When you open them in OpenOffice.org Writer you can view the
rendered image, even if you don't have ChemDraw. Even better, when you
crack open the ODT file the original ChemDraw binary is there <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> we were able to feed that to some open
source software that PMR and team were involved in writing and extract
data. The result of using OLE was: workable interoperability. That's
because OLE objects are embedded using standard interfaces not vague
hand-wavy whatever-you-like Custom XML.</p>
<p>If he'd turned up with a document authored with the Microsoft Word
ontology plugin we would have seen none of the embedded semantics in OOo
Writer. So, the end result would have been: reduced interoperability and
no upside.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You should rethink your attitude towards this matter after you have
checked out the facts first.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks for visiting. Feel free to correct any factual mistakes.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dmahugh/">Doug Mahugh</a> of the Microsoft Office
interoperability project also dropped by.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I agree with your view of the value of interoperability with open
software. Unfortunately, that isn<span
class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>t possible yet for this issue, because
there is no approach to semantic tagging that has been implemented in
open-source applications. When the RDF approach in ODF 1.2 becomes
widely implemented (assuming it does, of course), there may be some
interesting options there, but for now implementers need to either use
a product like Word, or overload styles (or something similar) to get
the job done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually, Doug, my question was for the specific case being covered in
the ontology Add-in. If I want to link a to bit of my text to a node in
an ontology why could I not just use a link,as in <a href="http://linkeddata.org/">Linked
Data</a>? Say I'm talking about my long suffering
mongrel dog Spensa. I might want to link 'Spensa' using, say his OpenId
and maybe the words 'mongrel dog' to some kind of taxonomy and/or
ontology (I guess a taxonomy is an ontology or is that wrong?). This
link could be styled to look unobtrusive in text, and could possibly be
automatically footnoted for print viewing and linked in some cool way on
the web. I had a go at this but I was unable to find a useful endpoint
for my link for whatever species he is, canus-spensis I suppose.</p>
<p>Or the case I mentioned of wanting to assert that authorship. What if my
local ePrints repostiory had a page for me-as-author. It might look like
<a href="http://eprints.usw.edu.au/authors/PeterMacolmSefton">http://eprints.usw.edu.au/authors/PeterMacolmSefton</a> and resolve to a
page that describes me and the works that are attributed to me with a
note there that says <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>if you want to
indicate that this person is an author of a paper, link their name as it
appears on the work to this page<span class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>.
That is way simpler to implement than the stuff we talked about in our
paper on <a href="http://www.dspace.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/206423">embedding semantics in word processing
documents</a>.</p>
<p>Now, this linking is something anyone could do with a little training
but you could build a Word plugin to make it easier. I'd have no
objection to that <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> particuarly
because it is possible to build code that can work in both Word (for
Windows) and OOo as we have shown in our ICE project.</p>
<p>If I'm wrong about simple hyperlinks being a workable solution there are
a couple of mechanisms in Word for embedding semantics. Styles are
probably no use in the case, but fie lds could work. A custom field
could contain the semantic info, it will get stored in the underlying
XML just fine and it will work with any version of Word. Why didn't the
ontology tool get built using fields to store the info? It wouldn't have
anything to do with wanting to sell more copies of Word 2007 now would
it? (I know, OOo dumps Word fields but it would still be an improvement)</p>
<p>Bookmarks are another (clumsy) way to do interop. I know this stuff
because I did a lot of checking of facts when we worked to build the
first interoperable citation toolbar for Zotero that would let you round
trip documents from Word to Writer and back.</p>
<p>I am well aware that this is a jungle. Microsoft is a big cat whose DNA
tells it to sell more copies of Word 2007. That's fine, none of my
business. My business, amongst other things is to help the people at USQ
make web pages and books from their writing. And they don't all have
Word 2007 and they don't all want Word 2007. I suspect that with the
ontology project there would be a more interoperable way to do the
in-document tagging. Maybe someone from the project could share some of
the background. Did you try to use fields? Did you consider interop with
OpenOffice.org? Do you test tagged documents that have been passed to
older versions of Word, edited, saved and reopened?</p>
<p>Now, onto the final bit where I think Doug is talking about the use case
where you want to author a document in Word that is later going to be
mapped onto a complex schema. After working in this field since 1995 I
am pretty well convinced that attempting to write a fully featured
editor layered on a word processor for the likes of the NLM DTD or
DocBook is not going to end well. I have seen enough of these things
marched out at SGML and XML conferences with great hopes and waited in
vain for the follow up presentation next year. Anyone remember
BladeRunner? Microsoft SGML Author?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In most scenarios people have a specific schema in mind for tagging
the content of the document, so with the styles approach you end up
imitating XML structure through nested styles. That can get very
complicated, and can cause interop issues for consumers that don<span
class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>t handle nested styles well. I like the
microformats/customXml approach because it<span
class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>s simple for developers to work with,
and consumers that don<span class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>t care
about custom semantics can just ignore it without losing any
formatting (as would happen if styles were ignored). It<span
class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>s also easy to round-trip the customXml
element, since it<span class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>s in the
WordprocessingML namespace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Easy to round trip in Word 2007, but what happens if someone without the
plugin edits a document with the custom XML in it, particularly one like
an NLM document where the stuff is all over the place? What if they
reorder sections, or delete a section heading? Has this been tested or
is the intention with the NLM plugin to recommend that people only use
Word 2007?</p>
<p>Doug is right that overly complex style systems don't work for authors.
Been there. Done that. That's why we have devised a simple, generic set
of styles that users can use to create structured HTML, on the
<a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/">ICE</a> project. Ian Barnes used the same styles
to create DocBook, and I'm pretty sure we could do the same for NLM but
all we would be doing is producing a small subset of those formats.</p>
<p>There are so many words flying around here it may not be clear what I'm
complaining about. So I will try again. What I am saying is:</p>
<p>We in the Academic community have an interest in promoting interoperable
authoring practices so our users across platforms can collaborate on
documents together. Therefore if we get involved in working with
proprietary software we should make a serious effort to make sure that
what work <em>we</em> do will work as widely as possible. <em>Our</em> goal is not to
promote Word 2007. If we could get the work done using an older version
or a free alternative then we might save some money that we can use for
whatever it is we do here in the academy.</p>
<p>I think that the XML format under Microsoft Office is being used as a
distraction from real practical issues of interoperability. Whether this
is good for Microsoft in the long run is for them to work out but I am
pretty convinced that some of the solutions coming out of Microsoft
Research are no good for me or my colleagues and I will continue to say
so and continue to work with my team to do things in a way that benefits
all of us.</p>

Days, Dev8D, made me sad.</p>
<p><a name="h8820e5a9p1"><!--h8820e5a9p1--></a>Hang on, didn't I just write
a happy <a href="http://ptsefton.com/2009/03/10/developer-happiness-and-associated-meetings.htm">trip
report</a>?</p>
<p><a name="hd78e92b8p1"><!--hd78e92b8p1--></a>Well, it was great to see so
many happy developers of course, but it was a bit sad that so few were
women. If there are only a handful of women joining in then we are going
to miss out on some great ideas and some inspired coding which is what
Dev8D was supposed to be about.</p>
<p><a name="h72dfecf9p1"><!--h72dfecf9p1--></a>I have a daughter who, at
ten, sometimes claims that she will be a computer programmer (and a
lawyer and a waiter). Will it have an impact that most of the pictures
of the conferences I go to show mostly men participating?</p>
<p><a name="hc03263abp1"><!--hc03263abp1--></a>Today, on <a href="http://www.pledgebank.com/AdaLovelaceDay">Ada Lovelace
Day</a> I decided to highlight
one inspiring young woman working in software development.</p>
<p>Linda Octalina works in our team at ADFI, programming the computer. She
built lots of stuff in the I<a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/">CE system</a> and is
now involved in all our projects in a variety of programming languages,
across multiple platforms. And she's involved in open source work
outside of USQ's employ.</p>
<p>Day to day our programmers are analysing business processes,
researching, crafting designs for software solutions and dealing with
lots of people with both reasonable and unreasonable expectations.</p>
<p>Linda is very tenacious at problem solving and generous at giving back
to the community. For example, in her work on converting legacy
FrameMaker course documents to Open Document Format she worked on
getting good quality versions of LaTeX equations for the web: see this
blog post <a href="http://lindaocta.com/?p=66">Converting Transparent GIF to PNG by using
pyPIL</a>, which goes into detail about one
part of the process. That post is going to save someone somewhere a lot
of time.</p>
<p>I asked Linda to give me a bit of background about herself and her
journey from Indonesia to Toowoomba. This is a slightly edited version
of something she threw together:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I grew up in small town called Pematang Siantar. Like most of the
other children my age, I never saw a computer. At the age of 14, I was
transferred to a well known school in the capital city of North
Sumatra, Medan, which is three hours drive from my home town. One of
the extra courses offered in this school was &quot;Learn how to Program in
Pascal&quot;. To kill my curiosity about what the computer could do, rather
than what it looked like, I took this extra subject. Two weeks in this
course and I was addicted.<br>
<br>
When I moved to Singapore to pursue my tertiary education (Diploma),
without hesitation, I chose IT as my first Major. With the support
from the lecturers, in the third year, I was selected and attached to
University of Queensland for my internship program to develop a
Seminar system for one of the professors. During my six months
attachment, I was exposed to Linux and open source software. I went
back Singapore after my attachment and worked as a programmer for two
years, mainly dealing with Microsoft software such as asp or dot net.
In 2007, I decided to move to Australia to continue my Bachelor degree
as I would like to in-depth my knowledge in Linux and open source
software. After I completed my Bachelor, I was interested in one
particular research topic and I enrolled myself as a Master student.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I picked Linda because she's a good example of an early-career
programmer who has followed her passion and is making a solid
contribution to the open source commons. She has a background and and
approach which will be a valuable addition to future developer happiness
day type events here in Australia and around the world.</p>

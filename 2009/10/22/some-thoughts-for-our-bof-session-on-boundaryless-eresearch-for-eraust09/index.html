Some thoughts for our BoF session on boundaryless eResearch for #eraust09

<p>At eResearch Australasia 2009 in November in Sydney, I'm going to to be
co-facilitating a Birds of Feather session with Anna Gerber from UQ, and
Peter Murray-Rust and Jim Downing from Cambridge; Jim Downing will be
involved but he won't be able to join us at Manly. The topic is
<a href="http://www.eresearch.edu.au/2009bof05">Boundaryless eResearch: use the Web, use Linked Open
Data</a>. There's an <a href="http://www.eresearch.edu.au/docs/2009/era09_submission_68.pdf">extended
abstract in PDF
format</a>
which I'm hoping we can build into a paper. I'm supposed to be starting
that work now, hence this blog post to try to get my thoughts in order.</p>
<p>The three things I most care about for this session are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Getting tools into the hands of researchers so they can 'do'
linked data.</strong> They're never going to read Tim Berners lee's <a href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html">Design
Issues</a> page or wade
through a
<a href="http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/bizer/pub/LinkedDataTutorial/">tutorial</a>
so we need to give them tools that help them do their work, back up
their data, publish data and both informal and formal commentary.
Right now Linked Data is Too Hard. I think we're going to need some
online wizard services and other tools that let people do semantic
web stuff without all the hair-tearing.</p>
<p>Anna's team, in Jane Hunter's group are <a href="http://www.ijdc.net/index.php/ijdc/article/view/116">working on this with their
Firefox Add In for creating compound semantic-web objects, for
literary
scholars</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Getting the web into the scholarly communications process as a
first-class citizen</strong>, as seen over and over on this blog, now
branded as <a href="http://delicious.com/ptsefton/ptsefton+scholarlyhtml">Scholarly
HTML</a>. A lot
of the discussion of Linked data is about giving things names, and
describing relationships in RDF, but how will real people talk about
stuff? How will they email and blog and wave at each other, with
those links embedded inscholarly discourse in a <strong>meaningful</strong> way?</p>
<p>Meaning matters. It's not enough to link to something; you have to
be able to indicate why you're linking to it. Am I linking to
someone to say their an author on this paper? To cite them? Or to
indicate that I'm talking <em>about</em> them.</p>
<p>I think that working out how linked data fits with documents is very
important and services like the Australian National Data Service
(<a href="http://ands.edu.au/">ANDS</a>) will ignore this dimension at their
peril. I mean, how are we going to bootstrap the data-citation
economy if we don't think about documents? That's, like, where
people cite things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bringing the web to the desktop.</strong> Linked Data is all about the
web but desktop operating systems are still mainly web consumers and
it's not easy to move desktop or lab generated stuff to the web; the
work we're doing with <a href="http://fascinator.usq.edu.au/">The
Fascinator</a> and Jim's team is doing
with <a href="http://code.google.com/p/lensfield/">Lensfield</a> is trying to
let people see all their stuff (including data and documents) as
part of the web from the moment they create it, by providing a
web-view of local files which is integrated into a system that can
move stuff to repositories, and publish, and back things up, and
serve as a platform for analytical tools.</p>

<p>Copyright © 2009 Published by Peter
Sefton A while ago, I got an email for the nice people at Elsevier
(actually I think it might have been from a machine, but never mind)
saying that the article I wrote for Serials Review is now available here
using this DOI:
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.serrev.2009.05.001">doi:10.1016/j.serrev.2009.05.001</a>.
At the moment that link seems to resolve to an open version of the
article, whether or not you have a subscription to the journal but I
guess that will change; when it is 'published' you will only see the
article if you are clicking from inside a network that's on their list
of subscribers. If not, you will need money to see it. But I can post
the article here with the copyright statement you see below and remind
you that you need to use the DOI to cite the paper should you wish to.
No naughty linking back here (unless it is to reference these comments
I'm adding). And no linking to the version I'm about to put in ePrints.
OK? Even though you know that if you do link to the DOI some people may
not be able to see the article in the future, don't do it, use the DOI
link. There, I think I told you. The version I am posting here that you
<strong>MUST NOT LINK TO</strong> is my copy, updated to match the changes made in
the approval process, but Elsevier have yet to add their very valuable
formatting (read on to find out more about what I think about <strong>that</strong>).
Also, I have to warn you that me, I don't understand is the license that
Elsevier is extending to you, the reader. I asked them a while back (on
June 2nd 2009). I got a reply that didn't answer my questions, ~~which
I present to you here~~. Here is the email of June 2nd:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear [deleted], Thanks for getting back to me. I have read the page
you linked below [PS: it was this link
<a href="http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/authorsview.authors/authorsrights">http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/authorsview.authors/authorsrights</a>]
and the pamphlet it links to and I still have two main questions. 1.
What should the copyright statement on my final draft read when I
deposit it in my local repository: (c) Peter Sefton or (c) Elsevier?
2. What LICENSE should be attached to the file? That is, how do I let
readers know &quot;those who download or access the PDF of your article
must abide by your copyright agreement with regard to this electronic
copy.&quot; Is there a single page statement of my copyright agreement in
its entirety somewhere? what rights Do readers have? For example, the
version (#2) of the pamphlet linked from the author rights page is
different from the latest version at Library Connect (#4) and they
have different rules about how much text users may quote from an
article. Neither has anything to say on how readers may store and
distribute my version of the article. Is that up to me? Can I attach a
creative commons license to it? Peter</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I followed this up this morning, but, until I hear back all I can say is
that while I can post this here with the copyright notice below, I'm not
sure you have permission to read it or keep it in your web cache or
print it. Caveat Lector, I guess. This is as-approved except that I have
fixed the most glaring problem with the references, a missing URL for a
self-citation from the eResearch Australasia Conference last year.

<h1><a name="id1"></a>Abstract</h1>
<p>The editors of this special edition originally asked if institutional
repositories are shaping and changing scholarly communications. While
the Open Access movement has had a profound impact, there is at least
one area where repositories are not. While repositories are Web-based,
they almost always contain only print-oriented materials which are not
fully realizing the fabric of the Web and its ability to link documents
to each other and to data.</p>
<p>This article will explore some of the factors that have contributed to
this print-dominated situation and then report on work undertaken at the
University of Southern Queensland (USQ) to make repositories more
Web-like, using a publishing system which was originally devised at the
university for publishing course materials to multiple formats. The
article concludes with a description of a new model for changing
scholarship by focusing on post-graduate theses and new journals in an
open access context.</p>

management systems</p>
<h1><a name="id2"></a>The problem: paper-based thinking</h1>
<p>Two types of software packages had a profound effect on publishing
before the World Wide Web. Beginning in the late 1970s, the word
processor provided for efficient production of text—words could be rearranged and edited
without having to be re-typed from beginning to end or altered using
physical means, such as cut and paste of typed text or obscuring
typescript with correction fluid and then typing or writing over it.
Then from the mid-1980s, desktop publishing began to democratize access
to typesetting tools. Because of this desktop publishing revolution,
word processors began to ship with a &quot;What You See Is What You Get&quot; (WYSIWYG) view, which encouraged text
production and formatting to become one and the same operation, Coombs
et al. give a useful summary of the state of the art in 1987.[1] Before
the Web, authors had become used to editing within the constraints of
the A4 or US Letter page. It has been argued that this WYSIWYG desktop
publishing revolution has had a counter-productive effect on the
progress of publishing, and scholarly publishing in particular, by
promulgating what Sorgaard and Sandahl call the ‘paper metaphor’.[2] The World Wide Web is now the key
distribution for scholarship, offering new potential for documents which
are seamlessly integrated with machine-readable data and with
human-readable visualization services for data as discussed by
Murray-Rust and Rzepa in their paper introducing the term datument to
represent this new kind of eScholarship.[3] Since the Web arrived in the
mid 1990s, writing tools, such as Microsoft Word, have failed to adapt
to a Web-based publishing environment.[4] Typical Web export from word
processors producing HTML is far from standards compliant and unsuitable
for use on journal Web sites or in institutional repositories. I will
show below how this works with the dominance of the paper metaphor to
reinforce the role of the PDF as the currency for research reporting.
Word processors are merely the most common writing tool for the academy,
not necessarily the best. Many proposals have been put forward for
structured authoring using XML (and before that SGML) which has worked
well in industries, such as legal publishing and the military where
specialist editorial teams can be trained and supported. Norman Walsh[5]
captures the essence of the advantages of structured authoring in a
contribution to a debate in the Journal of Digital Information. While
the principle is sound in a theoretical sense, experience at the
University of Southern Queensland (USQ) with an end-to-end XML
publishing system for course materials has not been encouraging—the completed system had close to zero
uptake from academic staff.[6] It is true that many commercial
publishers use XML in their production systems, but it is unusual for
authors to contribute XML; in most cases authors submit word-processing
files which are then converted to XML behind the scenes. I reviewed the
state of the art and the (very limited) literature on how word
processing might be integrated into back-end publishing systems in a
2006 paper for the Australian World Wide Web conference,[7] and in 2008
for the Australasian eResearch conference.[8] Since then Microsoft
Research has released previews of a Microsoft Word-based tool which is
claimed to produce XML conforming to the National Library of Medicine
schema, but there is so far no evidence of the tool being used by
typical authors. To illustrate the potential divide between the author's
version and the publisher's, consider that Elsevier, the publisher of
this journal, recently ran a competition, Article 2.0[9] to show the
future of a scientific article. The competition winner shows that a
journal article may be the Web locus for discussion, annotation and
semantic relationships, but this competition was built on XML source
documents which are created and held by the publisher, so there is no
way that a typical institutional repository could easily provide the
same services. This is a case where the publisher is shaping scholarly
communications, or at least exploring how to do so, but a lack of tools
means that repositories are unlikely to be able to do likewise. This
creates a distinct divide between the publisher's more richly marked-up
version and the version held by the author in word processing format or
the typesetting system LaTeX,[10] neither of which allow high quality
HTML unless the author has used a particular set of templates and/or
macros and has access to specific conversion software. So there is no
way for most author manuscripts, which are commonly deposited in
institutional repositories, to be turned into usable Web content, let
alone with links to data and semantic-Web content. The best most authors
could hope for with their version would be to convert it to PDF and
deposit in a repository, while the publisher can do much more with the
article. Against this background, our work in shaping scholarly
communications in the Australian Digital Futures Institute (ADFI) USQ
has been focused on three areas:</p>
<ol>
<li>Empowering authors with content creation using tools that are not
constrained by the paper metaphor so that, no matter what happens on
the publisher's side of the transaction, authors can use and re-use
their work as flexibly as possible.</li>
<li>Work on integrating with institutional repositories, particularly in
packaging, using the Open Access Initiative protocol for Object
Reuse and Exchange (OAI-ORE).[11]</li>
<li>Most importantly, providing the above tools for use by post-graduate
students writing theses; feeding new users into the academy who know
how to create ‘Article 2.0’ type content for themselves.</li>
</ol>
<p>These themes are discussed below, showing how the technology now exists
for authors to transcend the limitations of paper formatting. With these
in place, there will be scope for truly open journal processes to emerge
both with open and toll-access publishers and the discontinuity between
the author's version and the publishers will disappear.</p>
<h1><a name="id3"></a>The Integrated Content Environment</h1>
<p>The Integrated Content Environment (ICE) is an open source system
created at USQ for producing courseware.[12] In early 2009 ICE became a
core system, considered an essential part of the operations of the
university. In the ICE system, efforts have been made to make sure that
authors are not constrained by the &quot;paper metaphor&quot;; it provides the ability to preview a
document continuously in Web format during its production, thus
encouraging the use of styles and empowering users to create structured
documents in their word processor. ICE has one very important
property—while it is in some sense
an XML-based publishing system, the main XML format it targets is
XHTML,[13] while print versions are currently produced by using word
processing software in an completely automated process. This system
provides many of the benefits of flexible delivery using XML, with low
development costs for print production and a lot of flexibility for
authors to control formatting details while still creating structured
documents.</p>
<h2><a name="id4"></a>ICE features</h2>
<p>ICE has several key features</p>
<ul>
<li>Automated document conversion with a rapid feedback cycle so authors
can see their content in a Web context as they write.</li>
<li>Inline-threaded annotation in a Web view. The screenshot in Fig. 1
shows a colleague commenting on a draft version of this paper.
<a name="graphics2"></a><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/54c8bce5-397x273.jpeg" alt="graphics2" />
Figure 1. A screenshot of the ICE inline annotation system in a Web
browser, showing threaded comments.</li>
<li>Protocols for linking to data that support a document and make
research more reproducible, as well as live visualization tools.
This has been demonstrated in the TheOREM project [note we will
reference a forthcoming paper at Open Repositories 2009 here—details TBC].</li>
</ul>
<p>ICE can be used in three modes:</p>
<ol>
<li>As a complete distributed content management system as used for
course creation at USQ.</li>
<li>As a central content management system where groups can collaborate
on content.</li>
<li>As a set of software components that can be embedded in other
applications. This has been done at USQ to integrate ICE conversion
services into the Moodle learning management system, and some
experiments have been undertaken with the Open Journal Systems
software.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="id5"></a>Journals in ICE</h2>
<p>The e-Journal of Instructional Science and Technology (e-JIST) is an
open access journal published by USQ which served as a demonstration.
The final issue serves as an example of how ICE can be used in journal
production. This screenshot of a paper[14] in Fig. 2 shows that a
low-end journal may be produced in HTML and PDF from single source
files, but it does not deal with authoring or submission processes.
<a name="graphics3"></a><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/m26b1bb66-567x240.jpeg" alt="graphics3" />
Figure 2. A screenshot of the e-Jist journal in a Web browser. We now
have a nascent collaboration with the Public Knowledge Project. The
Public Knowledge Project is a research and development initiative
directed toward improving the scholarly and public quality of academic
research through the development of innovative online publishing and
knowledge-sharing environments.[15] With PKP we are looking at how ICE
might be integrated with their suite of open access journals, conference
and monograph workflow tools, particularly the Open Journal Systems
(OJS)[16] to provide the same benefits outlined above for ICE, with
authors able to see their content in both Web and print formats as soon
as they upload it, and with reviewers having the option to critique
submissions online in a Web browser. Related to OJS, work by a
consortium of Australian institutions[17] resulted in a packaging
mechanism for journals, leading to the ability for journals created with
the OJS to be sent to a repository automatically; proof of concept work
has been completed that shows that ICE templates, coupled to a system
like OJS, could automate production of Web and print versions of journal
articles.[18]</p>
<h2><a name="id6"></a>Electronic theses and dissertations</h2>
<p>While journal articles are most commonly distributed as PDF files, so
today are electronic theses and dissertations. The ADFI has been
involved in two projects which are attempting provide tools for thesis
writing which result in Web-integrated documents with PDF version for
printing and with data integrated as best as they can be into the
document and the production workflow. I presented an initial proof of
concept for ICE as a thesis editor at the 2007 Electronic Thesis and
Dissertation conference,[19] containing a comparison with other thesis
production processes based on XML formats, which led to a collaboration
with Murray-Rust's team on the ICE-TheOREM^20^ project which builds on
work in ADFI on converting theses to ICE format. Internally, we are
working with a small group of PhD candidates to supply an ICE server for
thesis management, where candidates will be able to store a thesis as a
set of word-processing documents, along with data files. Supervisors
will be able to comment on the work using an annotation system without
having to touch the original documents. Working with early career
researchers is one way to bring about change in scholarly
communications. Theses are under institutional and departmental control
so it is possible to influence candidates to work with innovative
systems in the hope that practices which improve the dissemination and
re-reproducibility of research will be taken up by these new researchers
as they enter the academy. In addition to the cultural aspects of the
work with PhD candidates, there is an important technical dimension to
the work on ICE-TheOREM, which is to formalize the way that systems,
such as content management systems and repositories, can exchange
content. The ORE in TheOREM is for Object Reuse and Exchange—a protocol that for the first time
provides a Web-native way to describe compound Web resources, such as
theses consisting of multiple chapters, with associated images, style
sheets and data files. The project has demonstrated how a thesis can be
created and managed with a word processor and automatically packaged
using an ORE resource map for automated ingest into a repository.
ICE-TheOREM has produced a new model for repository-aided thesis
production and dissemination where an author can manage their thesis,
have it backed up automatically, with a complete audit trail of
stand-off annotations left by their supervisor(s). When the thesis is
ready for examination, it can be placed in a research-office repository
from where the examination process is managed. There is potential here
for examiners to use the same kinds of annotation systems and evaluative
forms as are used by supervisors, but PDF for reading in print form is
also provided. Feedback from this system would need to be sent back to
ICE, for action by the candidate, which is a feature we have yet to
build. From the thesis repository, content is delivered to the
institutional repository automatically via a pull protocol Atom Archive,
as it comes off embargo. While the ICE-TheOREM work is, at this stage, a
proof of concept, it does illustrate a repository-based publishing
process as shown here.

<h1><a name="id7"></a>Conclusion: a proposed new model</h1>
<p>While ICE provides a ‘missing
link’ in the form of tools for
creating Web content from word processors and our work on ORE and
repository integration provides packaging and delivery mechanisms to
deliver data-supported papers into repositories and journals, this
technology alone is of little use when expectations are shaped by
current practice as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Institutional repositories are expected to contain only PDF.</li>
<li>Publishers ask for word or LaTeX documents which they then process
into PDF and, maybe, HTML without any supporting data or complex
visualization technologies.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no incentive for an author to create anything other than what
is demanded of them by publishers, which is typically a source file that
cannot be used to create anything but PDF. Above I have shown some of
the progress we are making towards a new scholarly communications
process where research publications and data are seamlessly integrated
as part of the Web, beyond the paper metaphor. Below I outline a model
of how a university such as USQ might position itself as a change-agent
to drive scholarly publishing towards a more seamlessly Web-based model.
This approach would build on one of the key strengths of the established
distance education model of long-form course content materials delivered
as Web-native documents via a core supported IT system (ICE), working on
two fronts:</p>
<ol>
<li>To take the proof of concept work from ICE-TheOREM and to do for
theses what we did for courseware at USQ and become the first
institution in Australia with a mandate for all theses to be made
available not just on the Web in PDF but of the Web, in HTML. The
most obvious way for a candidate to comply would be to use ICE but
other tool chains could be used.</li>
<li>To make the courseware process more like a research workflow by
introducing post publication peer review for course content, thus
turning an established workflow into a publishing model without
attempting to change an existing system over which we have little
influence.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first of these is a straightforward policy decision which could be
made by the university. There is precedence in that electronic
submission of theses and deposit in the repository is already mandatory,
as is the use of ICE for all new courses, so this would be a simple
step, accomplished after a year or two of piloting. This step is a
natural one in the approach of changing scholarly publishing from below.
The second point involves rather more interaction with the outside world
and needs a little explanation. One of the issues faced by staff is that
while they are responsible for writing course material, it is not
recognized as a contribution to the research literature and is not
counted in government reporting as such. Because copyright in course
materials is held by the university and these materials are managed
centrally, it is not even clear at times what the authorship of a paper
is. A proposed model would work like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>An author creates courseware which is published as open courseware
by the university.</li>
<li>The author writes a short paper abstracting a module or book from
the courseware with an explanation of what the item represents: it
might be a literature review or contain instructional design which
is the product of research into previous cohorts of students.</li>
<li>The author submits the paper to an existing journal or to a new kind
of open access journal, which would be article-centric and arrange
for peer review on a rolling basis as articles are submitted—with the output of the journal
deposited directly into a repository of papers on pedagogical
practice.</li>
<li>Reviewers would be able to recommend not only changes to a paper to
make it publishable, but to the courseware item itself.</li>
</ol>
<p>This model for influencing scholarly communications sidesteps
established incumbents on both sides of the publishing fence by working
with new academics on one hand and, on the other, a whole class of
research which is undervalued. If such a model does succeed then we
might be able to provide a positive answer to the question posed by the
editors of this special edition of Serials Review about how repositories
have influenced publishing models.</p>

<h1> 
More progress on exploded PowerPoints in a desktop repository 
</h1>
<h2>2009-08-17 </h2>

<div>
<div class="page-toc">

<div>
<p>Back in June I <a href="http://ptsefton.com/2009/06/12/desktop-repositories-smashing-up-powerpoint.htm">engaged in a bit of back and forth with Les
Carr</a>
about breaking up presentation files such as PowerPoints into component
parts, for ingest into a repository, and about the concept of 'desktop
repositories' I reported some progress with a ppt 'exploder' for ICE and
talked about future plans.</p>
<p>The team here has made some progress in their work on The Fascinator
Desktop which can blow up presentations into component parts. We're
going to release a developer version very soon that you will be able to
check out using Subversion (on Linux you can <a href="http://fascinator.usq.edu.au/trac/wiki/tf2/DeveloperInstall">install it from the Trunk
if you're really
keen</a>), but
I will just talk about the presentation handling and some of the
possibilities for that here.</p>
<p>What we have now is a system that ordinary users will eventually be able
to install on their computer to index their local files. The idea is as
I described it in the post <a href="http://ptsefton.com/2009/03/05/desktop-eresearch-revolution.htm">Desktop eResearch
Revolution</a>.
It will help you to discover all your digital stuff, see it and organize
it in a web interface, route it to the data-fabric and/or publish it.
We're up to the discovery bit at the moment, but building the whole
picture is quite a major project.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Linda Octalina wrote a file-system watching service, which other
software can access over a web-service to see what has changed (the
web-bit can be optimized out if needed later).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oliver Lucido rewrote The Fascinator so that a it uses Jython for a
lot of the display logic, to make it easier to adapt, and replaced
Fedora with a simple file based storage layer (Fedora will be an
option, but is probably overkill for working files on a
desktop/laptop/netbook). Ron Ward is working on a storage layer
using Couch DB, to see how that might work with replication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Duncan Dickinson has been managing the product and the release
process, and a new site being put together by Bron Chandler. The
whole thing is coming together into a project framework that we hope
will be a useful contribution to the Australian National Data
Service (ANDS) agenda.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most importantly, Linda and Bron came up with a tag:
<a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=tf4desktop">tf4desktop</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>At the moment, in the upcoming developer release you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>On Linux, start up the file watcher and the little JSON-speaking web
service that goes with it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start up Solr and The Fascinator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run a harvest script that pulls in whatever files you are watching,
or just peruse the file system, or harvest from a repository using
OAI-PMH. Want your IR on your desktop? Now you can. (In the next
release with harvester will be built-in and it will poll whatever it
is harvesting periodically but for now you run it manually.) This
script:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Extracts full text and metadata from a variety of files using
Aperture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Feeds likely looking files to an ICE service for rendering into
web-ready formats, this includes office documents in HTML but
also text to speech and video conversions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look in your web browser talking to a local tf4desktop portal to see
what you have!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I did a harvest of my messy home directory. (I let it be messy because
everything in there is just working copies of stuff that is safely
looked after elsewhere, I can lose it without losing more than a day or
so's work.)</p>
<p>Here's a screenshot when I search for 'Les Carr' on my computer.
Remember this is a very early preview release, but it is finding
metadata. It's found a few things including this very document.</p>

style="display: block"><a name="graphics1"></a><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/m1f3c6882-453x437.jpeg" alt="graphics1"></span></p>
<p>It's found a PowerPoint. If I click on the link (yes the link should use
the document title), I get a lot of detail about the file.</p>

<p>There's a link to view the ICE-generated exploded and reconstituted as
an HTML view:</p>

<p>And there's lots of metadata. For example here's a bit of RDF extracted
by <a href="http://aperture.sourceforge.net/">Aperture</a>:</p>

<p>This is the first time we've had all these pieces put together and at
the moment, they can be used to index and search a bunch of files; it's
useful already, partly in that it shows me that in a lot of cases the
metadata in my documents is, well, sub-optimal. The reason it shows me I
have ten documents by Pamela Glossop or 53 By Ian Barnes is not because
I do, it's because a couple of the templates I use a lot were made by
those two people, and I have not been setting the metadata in the
document properties.</p>
<p>I have just looked at presentations here, but part of the point of The
Fascinator is that it is extensible to deal with any kind of file <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> it will come with default handler for
audio and video and images and be able to find embedded data like
geographical points, but you will also be able to plug in handlers for
other formats, such as chemistry, or climate data.</p>
<p>I'll finish up with a few notes on things we need to do, to feed into
the requirements for 0.2 and beyond:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Implement the hierarchical search features I mentioned in a previous
post where you would be able to show a hit for 'dog' in one slide
and 'cat' in another but see that they come from the same
presentation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work out ways to reassemble slides (or pictures, or saved web pages,
any item really, into web presentations using something like the
'organizer' we have in ICE, and then expose these as OAI-ORE
resource maps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Turn the above (if they consist of slides) into a new presentation
by extracting and reassembling the original source slides in their
native format.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be able to push exploded PowerPoints (or plain old documents) to a
blog via Atompub, or to a repository via SWORD. We already have the
technology in ICE, via the ICE-Theorem project <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> bring on the one-click deposit! Even
better, do auto deposit based on some criteria like stuff I have
tagged as 'published'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow for batch fixing-up of metdata, like removing Ian Barnes as
creator of stuff he didn't create.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work out how we are going to work with backup system and file
replication schemes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look at closer integration with ICE for things like courseware or
theses.</p>
</li>
</ul>

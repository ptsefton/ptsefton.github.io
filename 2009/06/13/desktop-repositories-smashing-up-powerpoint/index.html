Desktop Repositories: Smashing up PowerPoint 
</h1>
<h2>2009-06-13 </h2>

<p>Les Carr has been experimenting with desktop repository services. He
started by <a href="http://repositoryman.blogspot.com/2009/06/managing-powerpoint-repositories-and.html">wondering how he might manage the thousands of PowerPoint
slides and
presentations</a>
he has, moved on to <a href="http://repositoryman.blogspot.com/2009/06/desktop-repository.html">converting them into images, with embedded textual
metadata</a>,
then <a href="http://repositoryman.blogspot.com/2009/06/more-on-desktop-repository.html">put them in ePrints on the
desktop</a>
and started speculating on how slides might be reassembled into new
presentations and exported.</p>
<p>These workflows are exactly what we have been looking at with <a href="http://fascinator.usq.edu.au/desktop/index.htm">The
Fascinator Desktop</a>, our
nascent eResearch repository platform. Our goal is to index and
understand everything on an academic's desktop, including presentations,
documents, video, images, audio, data of all kinds, everything; via a
plugin architecture which will be easily scriptable. We're in the middle
of a two week development sprint getting some of the pieces in place for
this, so I thought that picking up on Les Carr's PowerPoint work would
make for a good target for the end of next week.</p>
<p>The goal is that by next week we have an automated system that can:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Watch your home directory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extract metadata and index it so we can construct a faceted browse
interface.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And in particular, break all your Microsoft PowerPoint or
OpenOffice.org Presenter files into a set of searchable images, just
as Les has done.</p>
<p>We think we will be able to build a pretty cool interface for this,
so that you can text-search for individual slides but also get a
sense of their context. So if you search for <code>dog cat</code>, it will find
the presentation with 'dog' on slide one and 'cat' on slide
seventeen with a neat interface to show how they are related.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We have made one step towards our goal by doing something we should have
done ages ago, adding PowerPoint support to ICE. It's still a bit rough,
but ICE can now turn ODP and PPT into an HTML slide presentation with
images of each slide embedded in the page using a method inspired
directly by Les Carr's work. Here it is with <a href="http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/11039/">a
presentation</a> by Les himself (Carr,
Leslie, Coles, Simon and Lyon, Liz (2004) Archiving research data and
research publications. At,<span class="Emphasis"> Research Councils UK
Workshop on Publication of Research Results, London, UK, 18 Oct
2004</span>.)</p>
<p>I put it in ICE <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> where you can see
it in the ICE file manager.</p>
<p><span
style="display: block"><a name="graphics1"></a><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/m8a7bb09-554x29.jpg" alt="graphics1"></span>I
click the link and ICE renders the document into an HTML file, with an
image for each slide. OK, so at the moment we're not getting the title
of each slide quite right <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> but the
text for each slide <em>is</em> sitting in the EXIF metadata, same as Les does
it I think.</p>
<p><span
style="display: block"><a name="graphics2"></a><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/m5faeb050-554x142.jpg" alt="graphics2"></span></p>
<p>Now, using ICE's inbuilt presentation mode, I can press the button and
get this <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> that's the slide with
presentation controls:</p>
<p><span
style="display: block"><a name="graphics3"></a><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/m267a2e99-554x374.jpg" alt="graphics3"></span></p>
<p>This will be useful in ICE <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> where
it will give people more options, flip through the slides in web mode,
grab a PDF of the whole lot, or get the original format. But this is not
the end of the story <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> we're going
to use ICE as a conversion service, and view the slides using The
Fascinator Desktop instead. That's next week.</p>
<p>Once we have this done we could look at services such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fill a shopping-cart with slides and or other slide-like resources
and build a new presentation, via the magic of OAI-ORE aggregations.
As Les seems to be saying, you could reassemble the slides from
their source documents into new presentations by grabbing individual
slides. We have lots of experience with this kind of work on ICE
<span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> and while it's quick to get
started we know it is the sort of area where lots of maintenance is
required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Post a presentation to a repository, in fully-exploded form<span
class="footnote"
style="vertical-align: super;"><a href="#ftn0" title="If I cycle in to work this weekend and pick up the 7GB virtual machine we made I will be able to demo depositing the PowerPoint into ePrints from ICE.">1</a></span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Post the presentation to a blog as a series of images with PPT and
PDF download.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set up an automated zero-click deposit system so that if I tag the
presentation in a certain way it automatically goes off to the
archive. <a href="http://pubs.or08.ecs.soton.ac.uk/119/">As demonstrated by the Australian team at
OR08</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(If we had all that in place we could finally help Peter Murray-Rust
with his presentations, which are made up of web pages selected from a
huge library of un-slides many of which included embedded data
visualizations. By indexing all his individual pages we could let him
'shop' for the ones he wants, order them and then create a
presentation-by-reference which could be de-referenced and blogged or
reposited. Peter, can you make your slide library available to us for
experimentation?)</p>
<p>So far we have made some good progress on this goal of having a
continuously updated repository view of all your files.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Oliver Lucido has built a new abstract interface on Fedora so that
we can swap in other data stores. Ron Ward will be trying out Couch
DB, and we'll probably build a simple repository layer using
<a href="http://www.cdlib.org/inside/diglib/">Pairtree and Dflat</a>. I guess
we could use ePrints, or Zentity if we were so inclined.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cynthia Wong and Linda Octalina have built slide handling into
<a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/">ICE</a> as seen above. The approach taken is
to load the presentation into OpenOffice.org, save as PDF, then use
<a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php">Imagemagick</a> to break
it into images, one per page, then look inside the .odp (ODF
presentation) XML to find slide content and use
<a href="http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/">ExifTool</a> to add the
slide content as metadat to each image. Lots more to do here, but
even as-is it's useful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Linda built a file watcher application, which is going to be cross
platform but which at the moment is for Linux only. It, you know,
watches your files and other services can ask it via HTTP for a list
of recent changes, which it gives in a simple JSON format with RDF
inside.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Duncan Dickinson and Bron Chandler have been building a harvester;
the bit that sits in between the data store where we will be storing
all these slide images and so on, and the file watcher which will
notice when you add a new PowerPoint, or any other file to the
system:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A metadata extractor: This will be based around an bit of
Software called <a href="http://aperture.sourceforge.net/">Aperture</a>
which can extract text and RDF metadata from all sorts of files,
such as images and PDFs. It puts the metadata in the data store
to be indexed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A transformer application which can render PPT to HTML/images,
render word processing documents to HTML, generate low-res video
from master files and so on. We already have lots of file
transformers in ICE so the transformer will be able to call ICE
if it needs to. (Some of this is slow, so we have plans to move
this to another queue so it doesn't slow down the main
harvester). The renditions go in the data store.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A lot of this is similar to Jim Downing's Lensfield project <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> we have talked about harmonizing our
projects.</p>
<p><a name="Object1"></a><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/4a9f9459.gif" alt="Object1"></p>
<p>This may look like a lot of stuff, but we think that it will provide a
very flexible platform for doing useful work for academia, discovering
and routing files of all kinds. While parts of this are connected by
HTTP calls we are prepared to optimize if that proves too slow, but we
think on a desktop scale this will probably work alright. What's missing
from that diagram are all the other things you will be able to do via
the web interface <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> tag stuff, label

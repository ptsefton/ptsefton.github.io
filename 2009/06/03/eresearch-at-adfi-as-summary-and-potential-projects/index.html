<p>At the Australian Digital Futures Institute we work on eLearning and
eResearch. In this post I will summarize where we are at with the
latter, how I suspect it fits with the work that's going on at the
Australian National Data service
(<a href="http://www.ands.org.au/index.html">ANDS</a>) and where I think we could
do more, in the form of a few project suggestions that might spark some
debate if not some funding.</p>
<p>There are two software applications that form the backbone of our
eResearch work. <a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/">ICE</a> is an established content
management system which we are taking into the research realm and <a href="http://fascinator.usq.edu.au/">The
Fascinator</a> is a new bit of
infrastructure designed to bridge the gap between the desktop (or the
laptop, or the small lab) and the data commons <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> it is designed to bring repository
services to the desktop, but it can also work at the server level. Over
the next year I would expect these two systems to merge somewhat so that
ICE content services are available as part of The Fascinator.</p>
<h1><span id="id1"></span><!--id1--></a>eResearch research themes</h1>
<p>There are a two broad themes to our research:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="http://ptsefton.com/2009/03/31/scholarly-html.htm">Scholarly HTML</a>,
endorsed by <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/commonknowledge/">Jon Wilbanks</a>
as a good tag for what we need to do to nudge the web towards
semantics in his keynote at Open Repositories 2009: getting academic
writing onto the web with as much inbuilt machine-readable meaning
as possible. Under this heading we have:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/">ICE</a> is all about being able to make
web pages from academic documents. That might sound like a
problem that was solved a long time ago, but no, most research
is still published in metaphorical paper format (that's PDF). As
I argue in my forthcoming paper for Serials Review (Peter
Sefton, Towards Scholarly HTML, Serials Review (2009),
doi:10.1016/j.serrev.2009.05.001 (doesn't
<a href="http://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.serrev.2009.05.001">resolve</a> to
anything yet )) , only the big publishers have the tools to make
HTML from research articles as a matter of course.</p>
<p>It is important to get HTML into our scholarly communications
platforms because HTML is what the web is made of. If we want to
have rich interactive documents with embedded semantics and
linked data then that's going to happen with HTML, not PDF, or
Flash.</p>
<p>With ICE we now have the basics sorted out what's needed is some
work on ways to adapt journal and thesis templates, and support
for LaTeX.</p>
<p>Maybe we could do something with Microsoft Research along the
lines of their article authoring add-in (more on my visit to
Redmond soon).</p>
<p>I know that this word processing / authoring stuff doesn't
always seem important to eResearch but I think it's key, as
articles and these are the jumping off points for people to
discover a lot of data. We need to work on researcher practice,
probably starting with the newest ones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Related to ICE we have the work we have been slowly chipping
away at getting theses onto the web, not just as pretend paper
(PDF) in a repository, but as real scholarly HTML that can play
nicely with the semantic web. The ICE-TheOREM collaboration with
Peter-Murray Rust's group at Cambridge has wrapped up, but
produced a <a href="http://eprints.usq.edu.au/5248/">really useful proof of concept for Scholarly HTML
thesis publishing</a>, presented
by me and Jim Downing at OR09 a couple of weeks ago.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recent work on ways to encode document semantics in an
interoperable way. I have <a href="http://ptsefton.com/2009/04/19/ontologize-me-first-demo.htm">made some
progress</a>
on jamming semantic relationships into URLs so they can be used
in all manner of authoring tools, and Duncan Dickinson <a href="http://blog.duncan.dickinson.name/2009/04/easy-semantic-linking-for-authors.html">had a go
too</a>.
For example, Linda Octalina wrote some code that can take
semantic stuff embedded in a .docx file using the MS <a href="http://ucsdbiolit.codeplex.com/">Word
Add-in</a> and turn it into a
plain-old link. The idea is not to litter the web with ugly
links but to allow tools like Word or a repository to recognize
when a link is encoding some semantics and let you do useful
things with it while still allowing interop with tools which do
not understand the magic links.</p>
<p>I have now convinced myself that we could really give the
semantic web a good kick-along if there was a trusted service
which could construct links that encode metadata, citations,
references to concepts, and data embedding. More below on a
potential project.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Closing the gap</strong> between the desktop and the data grid with our
work on <a href="http://fascinator.usq.edu.au/desktop/index.htm">The Fascinator
Desktop</a>. This new,
in progress application indexes local files, and watches the file
system for changes <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> then
exposes all your stuff you via a web interface. The idea is to allow
researchers to tag and classify their research materials then create
virtual collections of material which will be routed to the right
downstream repositories automatically. This ties in with <a href="http://www.ands.org.au/repositories.html">seeding
the Commons program</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Program Aims</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To improve the state of data capture and management across the
research sector</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To improve the fabric for data management and the amount of
content in the data commons</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.ands.org.au/repositories.html">http://www.ands.org.au/repositories.html</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We've had feedback from all over the place, including inside of ANDS
that the Fascinator Desktop's 'sucker upper' functionality is a
missing link in the eResearch software stack. There are obvious
links to the ANDS work:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.ands.org.au/services/register-my-data.html">The Register My Data
service</a>.
Using the RIF-CS collection description language can we get
authors to label their collections and then see their data
routed from the desktop to the data commons and become
discoverable?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.ands.org.au/services/identify-my-data.html">The Identify My Data
service</a>.
Can we get some real life researchers (including ourselves)
assigning IDs to bits of data when we write about them? I have
wanted to be able to do this with stuff like sample word
processing files for ages; these are the data we work with a
lot. Can we associate a paper with a bunch of sample data,
identify it all and then make sure it is all deposited in a
repository at the right time? Not to mention stuff like the 7GB
virtual computer we created for ICE-TheOREM. Where can I put
that?</p>
</li>

<h1><span id="id4"></span><!--id4--></a>Some potential projects</h1>
<p>Building on (1) our ongoing work on Scholarly HTML and associated
services, and (2) closing the gap between the desktop and the data
Commons, there are a few projects which I think might help the ANDS
agenda.</p>
<h2><span id="id5"></span><!--id5--></a>Project: A <em>real</em> version of ontologize.me</h2>
<p>The point of my toy site ontologize.me is to show how a service might be
created where people can do semantic web stuff. I think this would solve
several real problems in a simple way:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Let people embed metadata in a document that is produced using
pretty much any authoring system. With the People Australia IDs now
coming onstream this is becoming a practical reality.</p>
<p>Here you go: I assert that I, <a href="http://ontologize.me/meta/?r=http://purl.org/dc/terms/creator&amp;o=http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-541658">Dr
Petey</a>,
am the author of this here blog post.</p>
<p>If I link to another Sefton, <a href="http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-481006">my sister
Catherine</a> then I'm not
asserting anything I'm just linking. Click and you'll see. And note
how we have all these different forms of our names <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> she publishes as Cath<span
class="footnote"
style="vertical-align: super;"><a href="#ftn1" title="I dare you to call her Cathy. Go on.">1</a></span>,
even though she's really a Catherine, I publish as Peter, but use
Petie a lot and the NLA has me as P. M. Sefton. The
URI-as-identifier makes this no longer a problem.</p>
<p>(Every time I mention this idea Bruce D'Arcus shows up on my blog
and points me to RDFa <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> yes RDFa
is a way to encode this stuff in a web page and yes we will do that
so that it can be indexed, but it's too hard and too fragile for
authors and flat out impossible in word processors to use in
authoring workflows.).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide standard ways for people to link data into a publication
(email, thesis, paper, blog post, Google Wave :-) in such a way that
downstream sites can choose to do something useful with the link.
Like, for example if you link to a sound file, do so in a way that
makes it clear to downstream applications that that's what you have
done, so they can embed a player, or if you link to chemistry then
they could embed a chemical viewer (that rotating 3d molecule trick
is still very popular around here).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow you to mark up the content of a document to show what it's
about, like the <a href="http://ucsdbiolit.codeplex.com/">Microsoft Word Ontology
Add-in</a>, but in a form that will
work for everyone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide some standard machine-readable ways to do citations using
links.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm imagining a kind site with a nice web wizard that lets you construct
these links so you can drop them into a blog post or a paper or a wiki.
The ANDS Identify my Data service for example could give you a wizard to
not only identify the data but what you mean by it. And ANDS and/or
People Australia could provide URIs not only for a person, but for that
person in different roles; author, editor, subject etc. Duncan Dickinson
points out that as usable interface between authors and ontologies is
going to be really important. Most of them wouldn't know an ontology if
it crawled into their lap.</p>
<p>I think that the ANDS crew might be working on some kind of online
storehouse for ontologies and taxonomies and I reckon my extra wizard
service would be a really simple but useful addon. We would love to be
able to build support for this into our word processing toolbars, our
conversion services and into institutional repositories, not to mention
The Fascinator, which could expose these semantically rich URIs for
every bit of data on researcher's local disks.</p>
<h2><span id="id6"></span><!--id6--></a>Project: Trying the ANDS RIF-CS collection metadata schema with real desktops</h2>
<p>We have been working on The Fascinator desktop, with a broad range of
users in mind, but we have one key user (not that she has the software
yet but we're getting there). That's Leonie Jones <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> who has loads of video, transcripts, geo
data around the battle of <a href="http://www.usq.edu.au/newsevents/news/vietnamdoco.htm">Fire Support Base
Coral.</a> Leonie
has made a film with this material but there is lots more that goes with
her PhD thesis. I think we should look at how Leonie and colleagues in
Chris Lee's Public Memory Research Centre might be able to describe
their collections in such a way that we can advertise them to the data
Commons using the <em>Registry Interchange Format - Collections and
Services</em> (<a href="http://globalregistries.org/rifcs.html">RIF-CS</a>). To pull
this off we need ways for users to label data and state which bits can
be released publicly and we will probably need a research-centre-level
repository server which can do the talking to the ANDS systems.</p>
<p>We're hoping to build software that can be customized to work with any
data set but which will generalize across disciplines.</p>
<h2><span id="id7"></span><!--id7--></a>Project: ASHT - <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>Australasian Scholarly HTML Theses<span class="spCh spChx201d">”</span></h2>
<p>Finally, something I mentioned in <a href="http://ptsefton.com/2009/05/05/three-big-hairy-audacious-goals-for-an-open-usq.htm">my post on what USQ could do to
assert itself as an open access
institution</a>;
theses. The<a href="http://adt.caul.edu.au/about/adtglance/">Australasian Digital Thesis program
(ADT)</a> is now mature, and
theses from across Australia routinely go onto the web, if only in PDF
format. One of the best ways we could seed a data commons, and influence
researcher practice would be to start with the earliest of early career
researchers. I'd love to see a project which took a few small cohorts of
PhD, Masters and Honours students and gave them the kinds of tools we
are developing to manage their stuff and to write about it, in a way
that will bring on the semantic web. This is definitely under
consideration at USQ, but it may be of interest to the broader community
here in Australia. (USQ has some responsibilities to ADT via our hosting
of <a href="http://cairss.caul.edu.au/www/">CAIRSS</a> but we are still working out
what our role will be).</p>

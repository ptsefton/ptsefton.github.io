The second part of my trip was a visit to Microsoft Research in Redmond,
a suburb of Seattle. It was my idea to visit Redmond, and Microsoft
Research kindly set up a day's visit for me. USQ funded my trip and
accommodation. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/exscientia/">Pablo Fernicola</a> took
me sightseeing and to lunch on the weekend<span class="footnote"
style="vertical-align: super;"><a href="#ftn1" title="I was unlucky enough to be stuck in Seattle for the Memorial Day long weekend, and suffered unrelenting sunshine and blue skies, instead of the hoped-for drizzle. This was exactly as Tom Robbins put it in Jitterbug Perfume :“With the absence of the cloud cover that normally caused the sky over Seattle to resemble cottage cheese that had been dragged nine miles behind a cement truck, the city, for the first time in memory, would have an unobstructed view of one of nature’s most mystical spectacles.” .  My hotel was right near the Seattle Centre where the NW Folklife  festival was going on. Sort of like taking the Woodford folk festival and dropping it in Brisbane's Southbank, I'm not sure if it was one of the world's most mystical spectacles but it was very inconvenient if you're trying to walk through the park. Buskers kept blocking my path, such as the Black Death Allstars    with their infectious but downright unpatriotic “This van is your van” (I didn't tell the travel office I had been exposed to the black death, but they didn't want me to come back to work anyway). As you can understand movement was so difficult that I got stuck there at the festival at times. I met some musicians,  for example guitar god Yusuf Kilgore  who told me about a Bob Dylan tribute night at the Conor Byrne Pub  where people kept talking to me instead of politely ignoring me like they do in Australia. One lady even misquoted the above line about clouds, apparently in defence of Seattle's weather. To be fair there was a duo there that did a great stripped back ukulele-extreme-Bossa-Nova version of Tambourine Man, and Yusuf's playing was pretty good when he turned up, about 5 hours after he told me he was going to be on.   I didn't run into Tom Robbins as I was hoping but Yusuf played at his birthday party and says he's really old so that's something. To keep away from the swine flu virus and the Black Death Allstars and maintain the peak fitness required for my job at USQ I rented a bike from Classic cycles  and took myself on a tour of Bainbridge Island past all the rich people's summer houses, at least 20 miles worth I reckon.">*</a></span>
<span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> thanks Pablo <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> and Microsoft fed me lunch and put me in
a town car to the airport.</p>
<h1><span id="id1"></span><!--id1--></a>Discussions</h1>
<p>I spent Tuesday 28^th^ May with <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/ldirks/">Lee
Dirks</a>, Pablo and
<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/awade/">Alex Wade</a>. I wanted
to talk them mainly because I would like to see Microsoft Word able to
play better with the web <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> more on
that below. I got to meet a few other people too:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Sumit Chawla talked about the Microsoft interoperability group and a
number of their projects. I am particularly interested in the
attempt to build an OOXML (.docx) to HTML converter which can work
without Word. One of the bits of homework I set myself was to look
into how well this actually works. If it can handle embedded
graphics and so on then we could look at using it with
<a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/">ICE</a>, or with a Word Add-in for scholars (I
have to say I'm pessimistic but I have not got it working yet). I
think the converter is a product of <a href="http://www.planets-project.eu/software/">The
Planets</a> project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chris Wilson who spent a long time on the Internet Explorer team and
chairs the W3C HTML working group made himself available to see if I
had an particular issues with IE <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> we don't really apart from the the
well known ones that are being attended to. Talking to Chris put our
little scholarly corner of the web in perspective, for example ORE
is not on his radar at all. I think <a href="http://ptsefton.com/2008/10/14/what-the-oai-ore-protocol-can-do-for-you.htm">ORE is useful and
interesting</a>
but it is very very far from being mainstream <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> something we need to remind
ourselves of lest we become over excited and over estimate our own
importance. Chris did encourage me to bring our requirements and
concerns to the W3C though, for consideration in HTML 5 and beyond.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/brian_jones/">Brian Jones</a> of OOXML fame
joined us lunch in an pretty good Indian place on the Microsoft
campus. I have exchanged a few blog comments and emails with Brian
over the years; it was great to meet him in person. Talking to Brian
about the way custom XML is embedded in Word documents and the
interface design challenges that introduces reinforced some of my
opinions of how the various Add-ins MS research are producing are
likely to fare, more on that below. I also tried to fill in a bit of
my knowledge about the various XML and nearly-XML formats that Word
has supported over the years<span class="T4"><span class="footnote"
style="vertical-align: super;"><a href="#ftn2" title="I still think the Save As HTML format in Word 2000 could have been a round trippable XML format which would have been much more approachable for developers as it was HTML based. I wrote an article for XML.com  back in 2004 about how to transform this format in and out of XML – and I think that might still be a useful technique.">**</a></span></span>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks all. It was a really interesting and useful visit for me.</p>
<p>In this post I will report and reflect on discussions with and about
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mscorp/tc/scholarly_communication.mspx">Microsoft Research's work on
eScholarship</a>.
There are a few things of interest:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Zentity repository, which is exciting in that is built on top of
an RDF-style data model that lets you express pretty much anything,
and potentially a huge maintenance problem because it is built on
top of an RDF-style data model that lets you express pretty much
anything.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The MS Word Ontology Add-in, which I think is an fine idea, about
which I have <a href="http://delicious.com/ptsefton/ptsefton+ontologyaddin">commented here
before</a>. After
my visit I am still of the opinion that it is going to be hard to
make it usable, that its lack of interoperability even with older
versions of Word is a major problem <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> nothing will make people drop a tool
like this quicker than a few disasters sharing with colleagues or
taking a document home and finding that an older version of Word
mangles it. I am also concerned that the fragility that results from
imposing a strict hierarchy model on top of Word's native implied
hierarchy will be an ongoing headache for developers and it will be
hard to provide a bomb-proof implementation. I hope the MS Research
people will take a look at the work we did to transform the markup
the Add-in uses to plain-old links but if they don't like that it's
open source so we can go ahead and do it anyway.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/chem4word/">Chem4Word</a>,
being done by Microsoft with our associates from Cambridge. I think
its heart is in the right place, but I am concerned about the same
things as I am with the Ontology Add-in; interoperability and
fragility of embedded custom XML being the two big ones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="http://officesword.codeplex.com/">SWORD Add-in</a> which lets you
post documents straight from Microsoft Word to a repository. I'm
very interested in this one. I'd love to see it integrated with some
kind of HTML conversion so that people can put web pages into web
based repositories instead of filling them up with virtual paper.
There was a meeting at OR09 to look at how Word might work with
repositories, with an incredibly strong response from the
<a href="http://eprints.usq.edu.au/">ePrints</a> team, who are very
enthusiastic about supporting this kind of ingest. Me I think it's a
reasonable thing to work on, but it is only one workflow, and I
think that we are probably going to see a lot of action in
intermediate content management systems that manage authoring and
data rather than the typical repository focus on dissemination and
preservation <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> most of the
interaction from Word is likely to be with those kinds of content
systems, in my opinion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=09C55527-0759-4D6D-AE02-51E90131997E&amp;displaylang=en">Microsoft Word Article Authoring
Add-in</a>.
I'd have to say that nothing that I saw in Atlanta or Seattle has
made me change my mind, I still think that this approach of trying
to edit documents conforming to a large complex XML schema inside
Word is going to end up as an unhappy compromise <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> if it takes off at all it will be at
the publishers who use XML, rather than with ordinary authors. Pablo
Fernicola thinks otherwise, obviously. Time will tell.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1><span id="id3"></span><!--id3--></a>Scholarly HTML</h1>
<p>Against this background I will confine myself to the dimensions I really
care about, which is how to make word processors produce good quality
HMTL, and document interoperability. I've been over and over why this is
important here, but here's a summary.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>On the authoring side, offline word processors like Microsoft Word
and OpenOffice.org Writer</strong> <strong>are probably still the best all round
compromised for academic authoring</strong> in those disciplines which
don't use some other format like LaTeX. For now. I expect this to
change soon, we are starting to see document drafting in Google Docs
(which lacks citation services and styles and easy embedding of
diagrams so far) , and if Google Wave realises its promise then I
think it could be an end-to-end scholarly communications platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>On the delivery side, academia is one of the few places where PDF
is considered acceptable</strong> as a means of communication whereas on a
normal website it is regarded as an impediment to usability. We need
to be getting scholarly works into HTML so we can do more with them;
meshing them with data and visualisations and delivering them to
mobile devises.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>While we wait for Google Wave to take over the world, what I'd like to
see is a Word toolbar much like the ICE toolbar to support scholarly
authoring but with better integration into Word than we have had the
resources to make so far here in Toowoomba. It should let people create
well structured documents which can be pushed to academic systems;
journals, repositories and learning systems and not just in PDF, or Word
format, in some kind of formally specified <a href="http://ptsefton.com/2009/03/31/scholarly-html.htm">Scholarly
HTML</a>. I think that
idea had some support at our meeting, but Lee Dirks in particular
pointed out that it would need to be done with reference to a
stakeholder group who can help define and own this Scholarly HTML thing.
I'd be interested in ideas on who these stakeholders might be;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Publishers obviously, where MS Research have great contacts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repository owners particularly the discipline repositories like
<a href="http://arxiv.org/">arXive</a> and <a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/">Pubmed
Central</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The eResearch community; I hope that I can get the Australian
National Data Service (<a href="http://www.ands.org.au/index.html">ANDS</a>)
interested in this stuff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Electronic Thesis and Dissertation
(<a href="http://www.library.pitt.edu/etd2009/">ETD</a>) movement. (My group is
involved in this via our
<a href="http://cairss.caul.edu.au/www/">CAIRSS</a>repository support service,
the Australasian Digital Thesis program in Australia will come to
CAIRSS at some point.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The eLearning community, maybe.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>But actually, where this matters most is on the long tail:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Thousands of small repositories and journals are stuck with
paper-on-screen because that's all their tools support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The small but growing group of users who want to do more with the
versions of their documents they deposit in repositories.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I'd appreciate any thoughts about who might be interested in defining a
scholarly profile of HTML <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> a few
people told me they're following these posts so please speak up in the
comments.</p>
<h1><span id="id4"></span><!--id4--></a>We are not working <strong>together</strong></h1>
<p>I'd like to make it clear that while we had a good talk there is no
project immanent between MS Research and ADFI; I think the discussion
was reasonably encouraging that there might possibly be some room for
collaboration.</p>
<p>First some ground rules about the kind of collaboration I think we
should entertain with any commerical entity.</p>
<p>I think it would be fair that this works only in the latest version of
Word, <strong>provided the documents it produced could be used in other
editors</strong>, such as OpenOffice.org Writer or earlier versions of Word. I
will <a href="http://ptsefton.com/2009/03/16/opening-up-microsoft.htm">quote an earlier post
here</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In conclusion I offer this: I would consider getting our team working
with Microsoft (actually I<span class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>m
actively courting them as they are doing some good work in the
eResearch space) but it would be on the basis that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The product (eg a document) of the code must be interoperable with
open software. In our case this means Word must produce stuff that
can be used in and round tripped with OpenOffice.org and with
earlier versions, and Mac versions of Microsoft<span
class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>s products. (This is not as simple
as it could be when we have to deal with stuff like Sun refusing
to implement import and preservation for data stored in Word
fields as used by applications like EndNote.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/exscientia/archive/2008/07/28/release-candidate-for-article-authoring-add-in.aspx">NLM
add-in</a>
is an odd one here, as on one level it does qualify in that it
spits out XML, but the intent is to create Word-only authoring so
that rules it out <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> not that
we have been asked to work on that project other than to comment,
I am merely using it as an example.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The code must be open source and as portable as possible. Of
course if it is interface code it will only work with
Microsoft<span class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>s toll-access
software but at least others can read the code and re-implement
elsewhere. If it<span class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>s not
interface code then it must be written in a portable language
and/or framework.</p>
</li>
</ul>

</blockquote>
<h1><span id="id6"></span><!--id6--></a>A potential Add-in</h1>
<p>So in a world where we did have an idea of what Scholarly HTML looks
like what would a Scholarly HTML Word Add-in do?</p>
<p>The basic requirement is that it would allow scholars to:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Write papers, books and theses as well as more ephemeral or less
formal documents</strong> using a single interface, built on top of Word,
working with its strengths rather than against its limitations.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It should be able to adapt itself to pre existing journal
templates,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>but also be able to help journals and institutions build useful,
usable templates that will produce Scholarly HTML automatically
and if necessary map to formats like NLM XML.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Post that work to the web</strong>, including to content management
sites, blogs, repositories, journal submission sites <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> everywhere <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> from within Word where that makes
sense (and it doesn't always).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Make documents which are as data-integrated and machine readable
as possible</strong>, with the things I outlined for Scholarly HTML;
citations, metadata, embedded semantics and linked visualizable
data. The idea would be to encode all this stuff in a way that could
be safely moved between systems and then to build web based plugins
that sites could use to make the documents come alive.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Some of this stuff we have already looked at in ICE, obviously, but it
would be good to look again at how we have done things <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> as Alex Wade said we should think about
requirements and leave implementation aside. So, in a departure from
form, I'll just leave the requirements above as-is and spare you my
thoughts about implementation other than to comment that it would be
interesting for MS Research to make their plugins work with the new Open
Document Format support in Word <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span>
via simple interop strategies like encoding information in URIs or in
styles.</p>

<p><span class="footnote-defined"><a href="#ftn1-text">*</a> I was unlucky enough to
be stuck in Seattle for the Memorial Day long weekend, and suffered
unrelenting sunshine and blue skies, instead of the hoped-for drizzle.
This was exactly as Tom Robbins put it in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jitterbug_Perfume">Jitterbug
Perfume</a> :</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span><a name="freeTextContainerreview36138843"><!--freeTextContainerreview36138843--></a><span
class="Emphasis">With the absence of the cloud cover that normally
caused the sky over Seattle to resemble cottage cheese that had been
dragged nine miles behind a cement truck, the city, for the first time
in memory, would have an unobstructed view of one of nature<span
class="spCh spChx2019">’</span>s most mystical spectacles.<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span></span> .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My hotel was right near the Seattle Centre where the <a href="http://www.nwfolklife.org/">NW
Folklife</a> festival was going on. Sort of
like taking the Woodford folk festival and dropping it in Brisbane's
Southbank, I'm not sure if it was one of the world's most mystical
spectacles but it was very inconvenient if you're trying to walk through
the park. Buskers kept blocking my path, such as the <a href="http://conorbyrnepub.com/">Black Death
Allstars</a> with their infectious but downright
unpatriotic <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>This van is your
van<span class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> (I didn't tell the travel
office I had been exposed to the black death, but they didn't want me to
come back to work anyway). As you can understand movement was so
difficult that I got stuck there at the festival at times. I met
some<a href="http://www.seattlebluegrass.com/">musicians,</a> for example guitar
god <a href="http://gertrudeshearse.com/band/yusuf-kilgore">Yusuf Kilgore</a> who
told me about a Bob Dylan tribute night at the <a href="http://conorbyrnepub.com/">Conor Byrne
Pub</a> where people kept talking to me instead
of politely ignoring me like they do in Australia. One lady even
misquoted the above line about clouds, apparently in defence of
Seattle's weather. To be fair there was a duo there that did a great
stripped back ukulele-extreme-Bossa-Nova version of Tambourine Man, and
Yusuf's playing was pretty good when he turned up, about 5 hours after
he told me he was going to be on. I didn't run into Tom Robbins as I was
hoping but Yusuf played at his birthday party and says he's really old
so that's something. To keep away from the swine flu virus and the Black
Death Allstars and maintain the peak fitness required for my job at USQ
I rented a bike from <a href="http://www.classiccycleus.com/new/index.html">Classic
cycles</a> and took myself on
a tour of Bainbridge Island past all the rich people's summer houses, at
least 20 miles worth I reckon.</span></p>

As HTML format in Word 2000 could have been a round trippable XML format
which would have been much more approachable for developers as it was
HTML based. I wrote an <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/12/08/word-to-xml.html">article for
XML.com</a> back in
2004 about how to transform this format in and out of XML <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> and I think that might still be a useful

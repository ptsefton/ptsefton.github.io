Journal 2.0: Embedding semantics in documents

<p>I started a series of posts on Scholarly HTML but I think it makes more
sense to call the idea I have for web based journal publishing systems
<a href="http://delicious.com/ptsefton/journal2.0">Journal 2.0</a>. I don't have
enough time to write this all up in as much detail as I would like and I
know from the comments that I am confusing people, but I wanted to get
down one more idea before I go on leave for ten days.</p>
<p>One of the goals of Scholarly HTML, sorry Journal 2.0, will be to have
embedded semantics in documents, like being able to say that the string
<em>Peter Sefton</em> represents the name of the author of this post, or that
when I say Toowoomba I am talking about a town on the Darling Downs in
Queensland, not some farm in South Africa.</p>
<p>There's a lot of it about right now, this push to embed semantics in
documents. Chris Rusbridge, for example would like to be able to do this
too, and not just in HTML, <a href="http://digitalcuration.blogspot.com/2009/04/semantically-richer-pdf.html">in
PDF</a>
as well. Chris
<a href="http://ptsefton.com/2009/04/07/scholarly-html-simple-rational-modern-citations-using-links.htm/comment-page-1#comment-188">commented</a>
on my exploration of citation using simple links:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a developing, if stagnant microformat standard for citations,
but they can surely best be expressed in RDF.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes well, they can be expressed in RDF and RDF can be embedded in HTML
using RDFa, but I can't see how we might get authors to deal with RDF or
RDFa directly because constructing RDF is hard even if you leave out the
syntax issues. That's why people are looking at tools like <a href="http://ucsdbiolit.codeplex.com/">Microsoft's
Ontology add-in for Word 2007</a>, about
which a few words have been exchanged on this blog. Chris reminded me of
Bryan Lawrence's <a href="http://home.badc.rl.ac.uk/lawrence/blog/2008/04/23/creating_rdfa">exploration of adding RDFa to his
wiki</a>
which I think illustrates that you can do RDF in a wiki, but that only
very dedicated authors will master the syntax.</p>
<p>I want to explore the idea of using simple links for embedded semantics
as <a href="http://ptsefton.com/2009/04/07/scholarly-html-simple-rational-modern-citations-using-links.htm">I did for
citations</a>.</p>
<p>Here's how it might work in a simple case:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I want to say that I am the author of a paper, so I type a version
of my name: P. M. Sefton. This could be in a word processor, a wiki,
WordPress anything that supports simple hyperlinking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I go to a website, lets says it's called
<a href="http://ontologize.me/">http://ontologize.me</a> and use the relation
builder tool there to pick from a list of ontologies, like
geographical, species, chemical, etc I pick <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>Dublin Core Metadata<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>, and choose the <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>Creator<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> relation. The site then asks me to
find a web page for my creator at which point I can put in a link to
my own site, to an author page in a repository, or search one of the
<a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2009/03/multiple-initiatives-vie-to-give-scientists-unique-ids.ars">proliferating researcher identity
services</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ontologize.me website will then give me a link I can use in my
page to link the text <a href="http://ontologize.me/metadata?o=http://ptsefton.com/about#me&amp;type=http://dublincore.org/2008/01/14/dcelements.rdf%23creator">P. M.
Sefton</a>.
It would look something like this (I have left the URL unencoded so
you can read it)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>http://ontologize.me/metadata?o=http://ptsefton.com/about#me&amp;type=http://dublincore.org/2008/01/14/dcelements.rdf#creator</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I click on that link, the the ontologize.me site could show me a
'sentence' saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://ptsefton.com/about#me">Peter Sefton</a> <strong>is the creator of</strong>
&lt;referring page&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Behind the scenes there would be some RDF which a machine could ask
for instead of the HTML view.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I upload a draft document to a journal website it could take the
link apart and turn it into RDFa so it can be part of the semantic
web. This is a bit complex as there is a literal string <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>Peter Sefton<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> involved which is related to the URI
for me which has a type of Dublin Core creator and the page in
question has <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>Peter Sefton<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> as it's creator. I think that's
right.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And to disambiguate the string Toowoomba, I could choose a
geographical ontology and navigate to the right page. To make a link
like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://ontologeze.org/content?o=http://www.geonames.org/2146268/toowoomba.html">http://ontologize.me/content?o=http://www.geonames.org/2146268/toowoomba.html</a></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now this scheme would work technically (I think) if people had to
hand-code these links, but obviously <strong>nobody would use it</strong>.</p>
<p>But with a good interface at the mythical ontologize.me it could be
relatively simple to use. Even better would be to embed support into a
writing tool, so you could make a Word or OpenOffice.org Writer add-in
which would make it easy to manage. I think the Microsoft Word ontology
add-in finds strings in your document that match those in an ontology
for example and auto-tags them.</p>
<p>But <strong>still nobody would use it</strong> unless (a) the results are really
useful, which is unlikely unless there is large community doing this or
(b) there is an incentive, like a journal requires it, or a department
insists on it for PhD theses.</p>
<p>Now, I'd like some feedback on this, and particularly I would love some
help writing out the RDFa for examples like the author/creator link
above.</p>
<p>Anticipating some feedback.</p>
<p>Won't the documents be incredible ugly full of all those links?
:   Remember the links are for the authoring stage. How the semantic
relationship are presented once the work is up as a Scholarly HTML
work would be completely up for grabs, I can image an author image
and summary popping up if you hover over a name, or a map if
mouse-over Toowomba for example. If this is built into a tool then
the links might not even show up as such, but are there for interop.</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be better to use real embedded RDF?
:   Well of course, and that's what Microsoft are doing with their
ontology add-in but <a href="http://ptsefton.com/2009/03/27/more-on-microsoft-collaboration-and-word-processor-interop.htm">at the expense of
interoperability</a>.
Others have dropped by the blog to suggest using the new features of
OpenDocument, and again I say that's fine but we don't have tool
support yet.</p>
<p>Please tell me if I making some fundamental error apart from the error
of judgment in inventing a whole new infrastructure web application that
needs to be written.</p>
<p>Finally, a note on how I got to here. I have been talking around this
idea for a while, trying to figure out how you could add RDF semantics
to an existing URI, like a URL for an author page, by appending
parameters or suchlike. But the problem is that this could break things.
Then it struck me that RDF is all about having URIs <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> so what if we had URIs for these
relations. The initial idea was inside out relative to the one above and
it involved adding parameters to a URI like so (again this is not URL
encoded so you can read it):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>http://ptsefton.com/about#me?http://ontologize.me/metadata=true&amp;type=http://dublincore.org/2008/01/14/dcelements.rdf#creator</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea was that this would probably continue to work, ie it would take
you to my author page, but when used to anchor some text it would encode
a bunch of RDF triples. But to support his you'd need a web service
anyway so I settled on doing everything from ontologize.me.</p>
<p>In summary, I think this could potentially help prime the semantic web
infrastructure. A site like ontologize.me would be a kind of wizard for
relating things to each other, and could serve as an online gateway to
established ontologies, with an extreme approach to interoperability
which need not be incompatible with existing laudable efforts like the
Word add-in.</p>

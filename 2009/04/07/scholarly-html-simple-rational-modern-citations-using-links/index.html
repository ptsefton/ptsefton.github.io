<p>I dashed off a quick post last week about <a href="http://ptsefton.com/2009/03/31/scholarly-html.htm">Scholarly
HTML</a> which had a
bunch of ideas for a new kind of online journal.</p>
<p>I reckon I was pretty spot on with my timing. Hours after I posted it, I
saw the announcement from Elsevier about the winners of their <a href="http://article20.elsevier.com/contest/home.html">Article
2.0 competition.</a>The
<a href="http://surguy.net/bricks/elsevier/00012998/0036/0001/05000486/about.html">winner</a>
has implemented some of the things I was calling for, which is great. I
considered having our group enter this competition, but apart from
limited time, the biggest issue I had was that the competition was about
what you could do with Elsevier's XML, not what you could do about the
elephant in the scholarly publishing process which is how the XML gets
created. Me, I'd like to see a Journal 2.0 competition that looks at the
whole process including the business model and the authoring and review.</p>
<p>The ideas didn't really spell out who does what and what the workflows
would look like. I will go through some of the detail now in a few more
posts. In this post I'd like to look at one dimension which was not
addressed by the winner <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> how an
author should cite their references. The winning entry does <a href="http://surguy.net/bricks/elsevier/00012998/0036/0001/05000486/about.html">look at
this after the
fact</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Enhancing references with DOIs</strong> - Digital Object Identifiers can be
added to references in the document, by the document author, or by
third parties. This allows references to be made more useful for
users. This is a specific example of the reference level assertions
described above - DOIs are added by selecting the Add Assertion link
next to an item of content, selecting a type of DOI, and entering the
DOI.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>DOIs are one way to identify articles, but why should this be done by
the readers? If they're good identifiers why not let authors cite using
DOIs in the first place?</p>
<p>I have one very firm idea about this I'd like to try out. I reckon it
should be possible to add citations using links. After all, I think, the
main point of a citation is to uniquely identify a reference. I asked
Twitter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today I'm going to think about citations - what do we need them to do?
Identify the reference, right? What else? #eresearch</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So far two replies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/petermurrayrust"><span class="Strong_20_Emphasis">petermurrayrust
</span></a>@<a href="http://twitter.com/ptsefton">ptsefton</a>
would be nice if we could find out when a publication actually appears
in print</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OK <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> but that's something that would
have to happen after we work out a good ID and how to express it is a
link. I'll set that aside.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/dorotheasalo"><span class="Strong_20_Emphasis">dorotheasalo
</span></a>@<a href="http://twitter.com/ptsefton">ptsefton</a>:
be suckable into bib managers; properly credit authors for
impact-factor purposes; allow readers to guess @ article's usefulness</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are all must haves, and they are all about metadata associated
with a reference. Given a good ID a machine should be able to do better
than a person at managing and presenting this metadata. The way we
manage metadata at the moment though, everybody is responsible for
maintaining their own metadata in their paper. Some do it efficiently,
via shared bibliographies and services like CiteULike, some use tools
like Zotero which are edging towards sharing, while apparently some
still do it manually. Just this week we have discovered someone at USQ
still wanting to teach people how to dot the Ts and cross the Is to make
APA references <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> get the computer to
do it, I say.</p>
<p>I can see three main ways to cite by link that I think might work. In
order of desirability:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If the article is in Scholarly HTML then it will contain
suckdownable metadata and be addressable to the paragraph level, so
it will be a matter of pointing to the permalink for the paragraph
or section heading you want to cite.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reference by a known kind of ID, like PubMed
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PMID">PMID</a> or a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier">DOI</a>, using
one or more sites that journals flag as reliable sources of
metadata. For example linking to a pubmed ID like
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12748199">this</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Linking to one or more (depends on the discipline) online citation
manager service such as CiteULike, Connotea or Zotero. Here's a page
from my <a href="http://www.zotero.org/ptsefton/568/items/17">Zotero
library</a> which I
scraped from WordCat.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that I don't include linking to any-old repository, journal or
website, or Google Scholar as the results would be too unpredictable and
the metadata is likely to be crap.</p>
<p>Journal-side systems could scrape the metadata from a page and provide
the information Dorothea recommends, like suckdownable metadata, pop up
abstracts and maybe author identity. Here's what Zotero makes of it
<span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> and Zotero' suckdowners are all
available so could be used in other code.</p>
<p><a name="graphics1"></a><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/m2976d43f-436x181.jpg" alt="graphics1"></p>
<p>How would this work for editorial and review processes? Upon submission,
the computer will fetch down the references and format them in a way
that is most convenient for editorial use <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> this could be whatever the editors and
reviewers are used to or some other thing optimized for clarity. They
would be able to give feedback on the metadata for a citation as
necessary just as they do now.</p>
<p>Another idea would be for the journal itself to keep a reference
database, and to ask authors to use it by simply linking to it <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> thereby making sure that there is a
consistent way for the same citation to be referenced across articles
and issues. This should vastly improve citation metrics. For example
they could put up a Zotero library for the journal with everything cited
so far in a canonical format, and require that authors reference that by
URL if the thing they wish to cite is in there. If not, then authors can
use one of the methods above, but as part of the journal workflow - and
this could be automated - the editors will create a Zotero record for
the new citation and update the submitted HTML.</p>
<p>And what about page numbers? We could ask authors to append a parameter
to their URL but that would be messy and would need tool support. So how
about just doing it like this, inline as the anchor text for a link:
<a href="http://www.zotero.org/ptsefton/568/items/17">p20</a>. Remember this is to
keep authoring simple it's not how the article will appear on the web
later, where the reader may even be able to choose the reference format
they prefer. Remember, though, with Scholarly HTML articles everything
is on one page with individually addressable paragraphs.</p>
<p>As with the previous post on this I am going into areas where I am far
from well informed. Are there already journals with simple, rational,
modern citation requirements such as requiring only DOIs?</p>

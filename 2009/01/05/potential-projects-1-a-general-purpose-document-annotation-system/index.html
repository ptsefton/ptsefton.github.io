Potential projects: #1 A general purpose document annotation system 
</h1>
<h2>2009-01-05 </h2>

<div>
<div class="page-toc">

<div>
<p>In December I was in Cambridge visiting Peter Murray Rust's group. I
have been working with <a href="http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/downing/">Jim
Downing</a>, Nick Day and <a href="http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/townsend/">Joe
Townsend</a> on the
<a href="https://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/trac/theorem">TheOREM-ICE</a>project.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Cambridge team for hosting me, the several visits to the
pub and to Peter for inviting me to dinner at his college. Luckily I
don't think there are any photos of me wearing the tie.</p>
<p>While I was there we also looked at the latest JISC <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/fundingopportunities/funding_calls/2008/12/grant1208.aspx">grant funding
call</a>,
with visitors Ben O'Steen and David Flanders. There was some <em>very</em>
interesting discussion but I'd better not say any more than that at this
stage. Last time I looked, the University of Southern Queensland was not
in the UK so we're not eligible for JISC funds, but we can work with UK
institutions as we are with the ICE work on the TheOREM project.</p>
<p>What I thought I'd do is put up a couple of posts about small
development projects where I think our group here at the Australian
Digital Futures Institute could make an efficient contribution, and see
if these ideas align with work that groups in the UK might be doing or
contemplating.</p>
<p>The first such post is on a general purpose document annotation system,
building on the work we have done in the ICE content management system
and our repository work. This project is to build collaboration service
initially for document annotation and commenting, but with scope for
several enhancements which are discussed below. I've talked this one
over with Jim Downing, and it has a lot in common with one of his pet
projects.</p>
<h2><span id="id1"></span><!--id1--></a>Why?</h2>
<p>One motivation for this proposal is that we have an annotation system in
the Integrated Content Environment (<a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/">ICE</a>),
which we have been using for document-centered collaboration throughout
this year and it has been a very valuable service. The system has been
used to seek comment from internal and external parties on documents
ranging from blog posts to grant applications to journal and conference
articles. The annotation system is a pure-web system where reviewers can
quickly and easily contribute comments on a document and carry on
threaded conversations inline.</p>
<p>While the system is useful, it has some issues <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> the main ones being that to invite
comment we currently have to add users to our ICE website and the system
is also tied to ICE. ICE is a great way to make good quality HTML but
there is no particular requirement for this kind of service that the
HTML be good quality.</p>
<p>It is very common to want to share a draft compound document with
reviewers and contributors. Often this ends up happening by emailing
around a word processing document, with contributions via the track
changes feature. While track changes works in small groups with
homogeneous software and serial workflows it can be unmanageable when
multiple people make changes in parallel.</p>
<p>Wikis are one way to collaborate on documents. We use wikis in our
software development projects for multi-authored documents, particularly
for things that change rapidly.</p>
<p>But for some documents such as grant applications and papers and theses,
it makes sense to write the document in a word processor, which makes
editing much easier than typing into a web page, with features such as
reference management (eg via Zotero) outlining, drag and drop table
editing, embedded data visualizations and drawing tools.</p>
<p>Google Docs is one option for collaboration. It has excellent support
for simultaneous editing by multiple parties, but it is a proprietary
system which does not support many of the features outlined in this
proposal, such as OpenId support, stand-off annotations. While an RSS
feed is available for comments this only applies to publicly available
documents. There are other free-yet-proprietary systems such as Adobe
Buzzword which suffer from similar limitations.</p>
<p>The main issue with proprietary hosted systems is that they are subject
to change by the owners, potentially without warning, more so than
offline proprietary systems. This proposal is to develop open source
software which can be deployed when and as needed and which is not
subject to the whims of a software company.</p>
<p>Another option would be to use a blog for seeking comment, but then the
comments usually go to the bottom of the page, not inline.</p>
<p>Some simple use-cases for this proposed service:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Circulate a draft paper to a group for review with minimal
configuration: simply upload the document to the server then mail
the URL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Request confirmation from a group of authors that a paper is ready
to submit, via a simple form.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subject a document to formal review where the reviewers are unknown
to each other, with the ability to both add paragraph level
annotation to make specific comments or point out typos and to fill
out a form evaluating the document. This could be used for thesis
examination for example.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="id3"></span><!--id3--></a>What?</h2>
<p>This service will allow ad hoc document sharing and commenting. It will
accept any web-renderable compound document via a variety of services
and expose it to for paragraph level commenting, using the annotation
system which has already been developed for ICE. The system will build
on prior work on schemas and infrastructure for representing stand-off
annotations, notably work done by Jane Hunter's group at the University
of Queensland.</p>
<p>A user will be able to input word processing documents, spreadsheets,
presentations etc, have them automatically converted to web pages and
allow others to add threaded comments to them at a paragraph level.
Below is a real example of this in action in a paper:</p>
<p><a name="graphics1"></a><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/m48c68cb6s542x208.jpg" alt="graphics1"></p>
<h3><span id="id4"></span><!--id4--></a>Document input</h3>
<p>Document input will be via a variety of means:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Simple file upload <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> if the
document uploaded is an ICE document then it will be rendered into
HTML and PDF, if not the service will make a 'best effort' attempt
to render to HTML using something like the save as HTML in Word or
potentially via a service like Google Docs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Via a URL, for web content; the system will be able to import a web
page and its associated images.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AtomPub, via any AtomPub client including the ICE template and the
ICE template along with Microsoft Word 2007 and others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SWORD <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> a smart SWORD service
will accept single documents, zipped web content such as IMS
packages or ORE.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Atom feed <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> documents can be
auto ingested from any service with an Atom feed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Email <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> a user will be allocated
an email address to which they can send documents. These would go
into an inbox, and the service will mail back a web link to the
admin screen for document sharing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="id6"></span><!--id6--></a>Commenting features</h3>
<p>The key feature of this service will be inline paragraph level
annotations as used in ICE.</p>
<p>Comments are tied to a particular version of a paragraph. If the
paragraph changes the annotations are kept, along with a snapshot of the
paragraph and displayed at the end of the document:</p>
<p><a name="graphics2"></a><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/m6406bda3s450x117.jpg" alt="graphics2"></p>
<p>Annotations will be stored in a 'stand-off' fashion, that is they are
not i nserted into the document but stored alongside it.</p>
<p>In addition to the inline annotations the system will allow for the user
to upload a form to be displayed alongside the document. This could be
as simple as two options like Accept/Reject or could encompass a
detailed assessment rubric. The form data will be serialized into JSON
and stored as an annotation.</p>
<h3><span id="id7"></span><!--id7--></a>Authentication and authorization</h3>
<p>Authentication for this system will be via OpenId.</p>
<p>Access to documents will be via obscure URIs with an option to make
documents discoverable via browse search or not. Annotation will be
subject to the following access controls:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Open commenting</strong> where the document is available to all and
anyone can comment, logging in with an OpenId or, optionally picking
a nickname without logging in. (TODO: Is there an OpenId service we
could use which can make it painless for people to mint a new ID for
casual commenting?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Whitelist access</strong> to certain openids.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Comments need to be treated in different ways for different use-cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Annotations visible to all reviewers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Annotations visible only to the reviewer who made them, and to the
document owner.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="id9"></span><!--id9--></a>Integration points</h3>
<p>This service is not intended for long term document hosting, but for
short-term document review (although it might make the basis for a good
blogging system or an add-on to a repository in future). Annotations and
form data collected about an item will be made available to other
systems via authenticated ATOM feeds and ORE resource maps.</p>
<p>The idea is that another service, such as a graduate studies department
thesis management system, which we are exploring in the TheOREM-ICE
project could use this annotation service to collect reports from thesis
examiners (who would log in with OpenIds and not be able to see each
other's annotations and/or form data).</p>
<h3><span id="id10"></span><!--id10--></a>Technical implementation</h3>
<p>Implementation for this project would draw on open source software <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> most of what is required is a simple
integration job. The following are promising starting points, but other
libraries and code might be used at implementation time:</p>

<h3><span id="id11"></span><!--id11--></a>Future work</h3>
<p>This system is designed to be a piece of research and learning
infrastructure which can interoperate with other services.</p>
<p>Future directions might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Adding a plugin architecture so other kinds of content than document
may be annotated (eg crystallography, tabular data, chemical
reaction chains).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reworking the service as a plugin for other systems such as
WordPress, Drupal, Sakai, or Plone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extending the annotation system to in-paragraph changes and
subsequently to a full online word processor (that is building the
open source equivalent of Google Docs).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tighter integration with other sy stems so that the annotation
server appears seamlessly inline eg in an assignment marking system
or in a repository. For example, the system could be embedded into
the Moodle learning system, with annotations being automatically
fed-back into the Moodle discussion system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extending the system into a blogging platform with the emphasis on
integration into academic workflows.</p>
</li>

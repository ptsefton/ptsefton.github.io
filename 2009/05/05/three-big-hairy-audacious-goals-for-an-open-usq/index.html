<p>I recently accepted an invitation to write a paper for <a href="http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/620213/description#description">Serials
Review</a>
for a special edition on how repositories have influenced
publishing<span class="T4"><a href="#ftn1"><span style="vertical-align: super;"><span
class="endnote">1</span></span></a></span>. While the Open Access
movement has obviously had a profound effect I looked instead at an area
where some, but not all publishers are ahead of the Institutional
Repository movement; in getting journal articles onto the web in HTML,
with embedded machine readable semantics and linked data rather than
just PDF. As part of that paper I hinted at a model designed to change
scholarly publishing, nudging it towards the web by working outside of
areas that are controlled by existing publishers and publication models.
In the paper this is presented as a two pronged approach:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Promoting web based thesis dissemination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Building new journals of pedagocial practice that recognize the
research that goes into creating courseware and running online
learning.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>But really, there are three things. I'll explain the other one below.</p>
<p>It just so happens that our <a href="http://www.usq.edu.au/newsevents/news/philipcandyappointment.htm">new boss, Deputy Vice Chancellor Philip
Candy</a>
is meeting with staff over the next couple of weeks, and he's asking us
for <strong>three ideas for the future</strong> where we would value his
assistance/input. Philip wants a one-page document so I thought I'd
cheat and use the blog to expand on my three ideas. Here are three
substantial goals to which I think USQ should aspire before someone else
aspires to them and steals the thunder. I think these would take us well
on the way to being a truly open university:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Be the <strong>first university in Australia</strong> to mandate that theses are
deposited in the institutional repository in <strong>HTML</strong>, with linked
data and embedded semantics as well as the standard paper-on-screen
PDF file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Revitalise</strong> <a href="http://ocw.usq.edu.au/"><strong>USQ's commitment to Open
Courseware</strong></a> and start working towards a
mandate for having all courses open within three years, staking our
claim in all the areas where we have leading distance programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a new journal or set of <strong>journals of pedagogical practice</strong>
which are geared to show how distance courseware is the product of
research processes, giving a way for the research that is implicit
in flexible delivery to be made explicit and valued along with other
research. (An idea I got from Peter Albion at USQ)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>I'll start with the theses. The Open Access movement is now well
established, and USQ already has a mandate
<a name="ZOTERO_BREF_ts8SbO6lWAH3"><!--ZOTERO_BREF_ts8SbO6lWAH3--></a>(1)
that all theses are to be submitted electronically and to go into
<a href="http://eprints.usq.edu.au/">ePrints</a> when the degree is conferred. This
does help to make research available to the community that paid for it,
but it is such a pity that in the web age we are still stuck with the
paper view of a research output. Citations are not reliably machine
readable, data sets are rarely made available and if they are they are
not linked into the thesis. And worst of all, the thesis is not made
available in HTML where it is part of the fabric of the web. Can you
imagine a university getting away with a web site which was PDF only? We
certainly try not to deliver courses that way<span class="T4"><a href="#ftn2"><span
style="vertical-align: super;"><span
class="endnote">2</span></span></a></span>. In most web situations
PDF is considered an accessibility barrier and yet in the repository
community it's the main game.</p>
<p>There are some universities around the world with XML production systems
for theses, where HTML should be available but as far as I know none of
them have achieved the level of automation that we have or spent as much
effort on the semantic web in way that will be usable by candidates.
This is partly because <a href="http://www.ndltd.org/community/research/xml">most of the
efforts</a> have used complex
XML schemas which are not a good match for word processing documents,
whereas we target HTML which is a reasonably good match for a generic
styled word processing document.</p>
<p>So why are institutions in general not mandating that these must be
available as web pages?</p>
<p>Well, in most places that would be because it is too hard to do.
Regrettably you can't just save as HTML from Word and expect to get
repository-quality web pages, or expect any-old LaTeX file to be
magically web-ready. You can read me ranting on about that in this <a href="http://delicious.com/ptsefton/ptsefton+xhtmlchallenge">list
of delicious links about how hard it is to make HTML from word
processors</a>. But
at USQ, we have a not-so-secret weapon: <a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/">ICE</a>.
The Integrated Content Environment is the core university system we use
here to create our long-form courseware a lot of which is very similar
in size and structure to a thesis. With Jim Downing and team at
Cambridge, we have shown on the ICE-Theorem
<a name="ZOTERO_BREF_4SA1v2e12Tcz"><!--ZOTERO_BREF_4SA1v2e12Tcz--></a>(2)
project how chemical theses can be created in ICE and published to the
web complete with embedded chemical semantics and everyone's favourite
the rotating molecule (they're taking this much further with
<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/chem4word/">Chem4Word</a>
which we will try to work with as well). Jim and I will be presenting
that work at <a href="https://or09.library.gatech.edu/">Open Repositories 2009</a>.
And we have a few other sample theses that show that we can produce rich
web-based theses and still have the core part delivered as a printable
PDF file.</p>
<p>We have the systems. We know it can be done. It's a small institution.
Let's do it.</p>
<p>Getting spectacularly data-rich highly-linked theses online is one way
to change the expectation of up and coming academics. They will be able
to continue to use ICE to create their papers and where publishers allow
it, will be able to deposit these as well into repositories, given the
right adapters. But as I noted in my paper for eResearch Australasia
last year
<a name="ZOTERO_BREF_Mx7cus7FtjSV"><!--ZOTERO_BREF_Mx7cus7FtjSV--></a>(3),
the big problem is that publishers are not set up to accept rich
documents, so there is little reason for people to care. I still like
the example of Peter Murray-Rust writing a paper using a web editing
package, all about semantically rich publishing. Then having to put it
into Microsoft Word to submit it to the journal
<a name="ZOTERO_BREF_6qmEY9wwuCsa"><!--ZOTERO_BREF_6qmEY9wwuCsa--></a>(4).</p>
<p>My proposed solution to that? Make new publishers who do accept
semantically rich HTML. And I know just the area we need them. Years ago
Peter Albion here at USQ noted that it would great if courses, or parts
thereof, could be valued as peer reviewed literature. On an ad-hoc basis
that could happen. You could submit a literature review to a journal and
use the same thing as part of the course, if you could navigate the
copyright. But what if there were a place you could submit an existing
bit of course with a brief paper describing how it represents the
outcome of novel research. It could have been reworked due to student
feedback, or stand alone as a literature review. An awful lot of what
our course writers do is based on research into teaching and learning
<span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> it's just that nobody has the time
to write it up as such.</p>
<p>The easiest way to make this all happen would be to base it on open
courseware. The submitted papers would be required to point to openly
available materials, under an appropriate license, and the published
work would end up being an aggregation of the paper and the course
materials. I am imagining a pipeline model with no issues, with articles
sent for peer review as they come in, and published using on online open
access repository as soon as they are approved. (If this kind of thing
exists then please let me know in the comments, I've had a look and an
ask around and I could not find reference to this kind of model).</p>
<p>The journal would provide a DOI to access the aggregate work, so it
could be cited (or included with attribution) in other courses and/or
research. This would provide a way for open courseware to be valued
using the systems of metrics and government reporting we already have,
and potentially kick-start the revolution that I'm sure is coming in
open distance education where we can remove some of the redundancy
that's built into the system, where we all write and jealously guard our
own materials and yet don't get recognized for them.</p>
<p>Which brings us to open courseware. When USQ was looking at joining the
Open Courseware consortium (OCW) Cameron Loudon and I did lots of work
on the benefits, looking at it from institutional, departmental,
teacher, student and outsider views. You can see the initial approach
taken by USQ in Jim Taylor's paper, <em>Open Courseware Futures: Creating a
Parallel Universe</em>
<a name="ZOTERO_BREF_VlyvikRPPiQM"><!--ZOTERO_BREF_VlyvikRPPiQM--></a><em>(5)</em>
which focused on open academic support (largely via volunteers) and
assessment on demand services.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.ocwconsortium.org/help/148.html">OCWC site includes
this</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An OpenCourseWare is a free and open digital publication of high
quality university-level teaching materials <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> including syllabi, lecture notes,
assignments, and exams <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> organized
as courses. OpenCourseWare (OCW) initiatives typically do not provide
a degree, credit or certification, or access to instructors. The
materials are made available under open licenses, for use and
adaptation by educators and learners around the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An OCW project differs from other Web-based education offerings in
that it is free and open, and because it takes an institutional
approach to online course publication. OCW is not a distance-learning
initiative. Distance learning involves the active exchange of
information between faculty and students, with the goal of obtaining
some form of a credential.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They are at pains to point out that OCW is not the same as distance
education, but plenty of people have noticed the contrast between
classroom materials published on the web, and real distance materials,
such as we have at USQ. Which would you rather use if you were a
self-directed learner? PowerPoint slides minus the MIT professor, or a
couple of hundred pages of exposition with input from an instructional
designer? (OK, so maybe you'd still want to watch the MIT lectures.)</p>
<p>I think it's worth revisiting OCW at USQ. I will go through what I see
as the benefits for the major stakeholders. Lets start with the most
distant stakeholder, the generic <strong>outsider</strong>. There are three main
beneficiaries of USQ's open courseware.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Society at large.</strong> Just as with open access to research data and
publications, we're talking about publicly funded institutions like
USQ creating course materials, why should they be toll-access?</p>
<p>Imagine if teaching materials were like research publications, where
instead of doing the same work over again you were able build on
prior work. Someone has already done something similar? Then use it
and improve on it and publish the reasons your changes are
improvements. There is a lot more sharing going on in the schools
and vocational sector.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Learners who find and use materials.</strong> Thinking of studying with
USQ? Have a look at the course materials first (if we put up a
decent amount that is). Some learners might be happy to just read
along and maybe do the activities. In Jim Taylor's model an army of
volunteers would assist them, but whether or not that comes to pass,
I can see quite a few learners who arrive via Google exploring our
materials.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Academics who want to use the materials</strong>. This group would get
the benefit of using or adapting pre-made stuff. Given our small
start in the game I don't think we've seen much reuse of the open
materials we put up, but my colleague Shirley Reushle reports that
she often sees unauthorized reuse of her materials which are
copyright USQ and very clearly not published under an open license.
It would be better for Shirley if the reuse was official, and even
better if we could make that count as a citation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For <strong>USQ's students</strong> one of the main benefits would be that they would
be licensed to keep materials and legally share them with colleagues or
rework them for new situations.</p>
<p>For <strong>our own staff</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You get to <strong>keep access to your work</strong> when you move on rather than
having to redo it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can share your work with colleagues and <strong>potential new
employers</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we set up the journal infrastructure I talked about above, you
can <strong>get recognition</strong> for work in a way that has not been possible
before.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may get feedback from outsiders, including, potentially
<strong>improvements</strong> that you can use in your own practice.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For the <strong>institution, the biggest benefit</strong> I can see would be all the
<strong>search engine traffic</strong> if we put all our engaging materials online. I
know from working with USQ courses that lots of the material is really
interesting. Some of the visitors will want to stay and study, so we
would have to provide a pathway from the open courseware 'in the raw' to
studying at USQ. Jim Taylor looks at stuff like assessment on demand in
his paper. There's also the fact that for enrolled students we have
collected readings and some other licensed materials that we can't put
on the web so, signing up will get them access to those. We would have
to be aware of the requirements of the OCW consortium, which I'm pretty
sure is not intended to let institutions set up shop-fronts with an open
courseware window.</p>
<p>Beyond the bums-on-seats approach there is also the fact that this is
The Right Thing To Do. Public University funding resulting in publicly
available materials. Access for everyone with a net connection.</p>
<p>Some people want to talk about risks, I'm sure. We heard quite a few of
these at USQ when the OCW was first mooted. The two big ones I remember
hearing were:</p>
<p>We might be exposing poor quality courseware
:   If we did happen to have the odd bit of poor quality courseware then
I think the bigger risk would be continuing to deliver it to the
students and hiding the fact that we're doing so. If we have stuff
that needs attention then our internal quality systems should be
catching it long before it hits the web, just the fact that it's
going to be open might make authors try a little harder. Then when
we do have stuff on the web then we can provide ways for people to
give feedback, corrections and suggestions.</p>
<p>We would be giving away our courseware to &lt;insert competitor here&gt;
:   Well yes we would<a href="#ftn3"><span style="vertical-align: super;"><span
class="endnote">3</span></span></a>, but remember that every
time they use it they will be advertising USQ's leadership because
of the attribution clause in the Creative Commons license. Teaching
someone else's course might seem a bit strange at first, but In my
opinion this is one of those things that will happen, like the
gradual change from per-call charging for phone calls to <a href="http://www.skype.com/campaigns/skypeon3/">data-based
charging</a>, nobody wants to
be first and cannibalize their own market, but it would be
disastrous to move last. The sooner more of the quality distance
universities gets a stake In the ground like <a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/">the Open University in
the UK with their OpenLearn</a>, the
greater their ongoing share of the copyright in materials once they
start to be used elsewhere. Don't forget that Open Source and OCW
are based on copyright and whoever holds the copyright in the first
version gets the attribution.
:   Back to the <a href="http://www.ocwconsortium.org/help/148.html">FAQ at
OCW</a>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; Through OCW, the publisher grants the right to anyone to use the
&gt; materials, either &quot;as is,&quot; or in a modified form. There is no
&gt; restriction on how a user can modify the materials for the user's
&gt; purpose. Materials may be edited, translated, combined with
&gt; someone else's materials, reformatted, or changed in any other
&gt; way. However, most OCW projects share three requirements that an
&gt; OCW user must meet to use the materials:
&gt;
&gt; -   &lt;span class=&quot;Strong_20_Emphasis&quot;&gt;Non-commercial&lt;/span&gt;: Use of
&gt;     OCW materials is open to all except for profit-making entities
&gt;     who charge a fee for access to educational materials.
&gt;
&gt; -   &lt;span class=&quot;Strong_20_Emphasis&quot;&gt;Attribution&lt;/span&gt;: Any and

<p>:   Anyway, universities are really differentiated by a lot of other
factors <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> including, one would
think, the teaching staff and their methods and the colour of their
website.</p>
<p>None of this is up to me of course, I'm just attempting to rekindle a
conversation about open courseware, in the hope that we can do something
big and significant based our corpus of world leading distance materials
while the field is still relatively clear.</p>
<p>The thesis idea <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> to make it
compulsory for all USQ theses and dissertations to be put on the web as
fair dinkum web pages is actually very doable <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> after all we have made that commitment
with our learning materials. The other stuff, like setting up journals
is a tiny bit more challenging but we have already taken the first
steps.</p>

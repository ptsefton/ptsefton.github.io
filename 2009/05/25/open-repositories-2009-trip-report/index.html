<p>Here's my summary of my experience of <a href="https://or09.library.gatech.edu/index.php">OR09 it Atlanta Georgia
USA</a>. Tim McCallum and I came
over from USQ and arrived on Friday night after 30 plus hours of
traveling, for a Monday start. Tim discovered that if you lose the
posters due to severe fatigue then getting them printed out on the
Georgia Tech library's plotter is easy and cheap.</p>
<p>There were only a few Australians this time. I was surprised that there
was nobody to represent/promote Fez or Mudadora, two antipodean
repository solutions based on Fedora Commons but I did meet a Muradora
user, Juan Rodriguez from the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center who
knows the Muradora team <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> sounds
like it's alive and well.</p>
<p>I'll go through some general impressions of the conference then
summarize my direct contribution; moderating a session, giving a couple
of papers, presenting a poster, serving as a judge on the <a href="http://or09.library.gatech.edu/challenge.php">Developer
Challenge</a> and attending
workshops and meetings with Microsoft Research. This is, of course, a
personal view. As with any conference I missed stuff while I was working
on presentations, plotting, having a jetlag-management nap, looking out
the window, or judging the competition etc.</p>
<h1><span id="id1"></span><!--id1--></a>Overall impressions</h1>
<p>Lots of people I have talked to have remarked on the movement towards
modularity, where repositories are not monolithic systems but sets of
services. I can't remember who it was who reminded me of Clifford
Lynch's 2003 definition of a repository as a 'set of services':</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In my view, a university-based institutional repository is a set of
services that a university offers to the members of its community for
the management and dissemination of digital materials created by the
institution and its community members. It is most essentially an
organizational commitment to the stewardship of these digital
materials, including long-term preservation where appropriate, as well
as organization and access or distribution. While operational
responsibility for these services may reasonably be situated in
different organizational units at different universities, an effective
institutional repository of necessity represents a collaboration among
librarians, information technologists, archives and records mangers,
faculty, and university administrators and policymakers. At any given
point in time, an institutional repository will be supported by a set
of information technologies, but a key part of the services that
comprise an institutional repository is the management of
technological changes, and the migration of digital content from one
set of technologies to the next as part of the organizational
commitment to providing repository services. An institutional
repository is not simply a fixed set of software and hardware.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.arl.org/resources/pubs/br/br226/br226ir.shtml">http://www.arl.org/resources/pubs/br/br226/br226ir.shtml</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree. It's not a computer program, it's a lifestyle; what Lynch is
calling <em>organizational commitment</em>.</p>
<p>I think the title of a presentation from John Kunze, Stephen Abrams and
Patricia Cruse of the California Digital Library (CDL), <a href="https://or09.library.gatech.edu/general95.php">Permanent
Objects, Disposable
Systems</a> summed this up
really nicely. I liked the stuff from the CDL and Library of Congress
looking at simple ways to describe and move data; the 'non-repository'
movement. We'll be looking into
<a href="http://www.cdlib.org/inside/diglib/bagit/bagitspec.html">BagIt</a>,
<a href="http://www.cdlib.org/inside/diglib/pairtree/pairtreespec.html">Pairtree</a>,
<a href="http://www.cdlib.org/inside/diglib/">Dflat, etc</a>, particularly for our
work on The Fascinator Desktop where we need tested, safe, documented
ways to organize data in way that is as lightweight as possible.</p>
<p>I had a little moment in the spotlight when keynote speaker John
Willbanks referenced my '<a href="http://ptsefton.com/2009/03/31/scholarly-html.htm">Scholarly
HTML</a>' idea. This was
reported in Twitter thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/akosavic">akosavic</a>
<a name="msgtxt1840176967"><!--msgtxt1840176967--></a><strong>Wilbanks</strong> at
<a href="http://twitter.com/search?q=%23or09">#<strong>or09</strong></a>: rename &quot;semantic
web<span class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> as &quot;scholarly HTML&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there you have it, meet the saviour of the semantic web. Move over
Sir Tim.</p>
<p>Actually I wouldn't go that far <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span>
what I am trying to get at with this Scholarly HTML is that the research
article <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> our unit of academic
currency should be a web page, not a bit of pretend paper, a PDF.
Journals need to be reinvented. Articles should be web pages (yes we
need ways to time-stamp and version them). Peer review and editing are
both important, but I can think of better ways to get those done than we
typically use now. Then there's the idea of embedding machine readable
semantics in the form of statements of fact, links to data etc, not to
mention machine readable metadata. More on this soon here on the blog
<span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> I think I'll write a series of
papers on this, with appropriate collaborators, in the open then we'll
see if we can get them to count as scholarly literature via peer review.
A couple of people told me they're watching the Scholarly HTML posts so
I think I'm onto something with this one.</p>
<h1><span id="id2"></span><!--id2--></a>Repository sustainability</h1>
<p>I was asked by email before the conference to moderate a session,
<a href="https://or09.library.gatech.edu/general1.php">Strategies for Innovation and Sustainability: Insights from Leaders of
Open Source Repository
Organizations</a>. Chairing
sessions is my least favourite part of conferences, but I said yes. What
they didn't explain was that this was not just paper session, it was a
panel session, where the moderator had to do more than just introduce
the speakers. On stage with me were the leaders of the three major
repository platforms. Michele Kimpton of the DSpace Foundation, Sandy
Payette from Fedora Commons, Les Carr of ePrints fame from the
University of Southampton and Lee Dirks of Microsoft Research.</p>
<p>The big news this conference was the recent merger between the DSpace
and Fedora Commons organizations to form
<a href="http://www.duraspace.org/">DuraSpace</a>. That meant that I got to
introduce Lee from Microsoft as the new player in the open source world
battling a creeping DuraSpace monopoly (Microsoft's new repository
<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/48e60ac1-a95a-4163-a23d-28a914007743/">Zentity</a>
is likely to be released as OSS). Before I left for the US my partner
advised me not to call Microsoft the 'underdog' <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> so I didn't.</p>
<p>The three organizations on the panel each had ten minutes or so to talk
about how they are set up to sustain their open source software. I don't
think there was much definite there. The DuraSpace crew are still
working out a sustainability model, while ePrints remains driven very
much by Southampton, but with some cash coming in from selling services.
The Zentity repository is too young too need a sustainability model
<span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> it needs an adoptability model.</p>
<p>My question to the panel was basically to ask them to play devil's
advocate and ask them 'what's the worst thing that could happen'.</p>
<p>In the case of the new MS Repository, Zentity Lee was upfront <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> if there's no uptake then the product
will not be supported. That's basically the same as with any repository,
but this one will be a bit different if it takes off, as it's what Sandy
called 'open at the edges' in that it runs only on the Microsoft
software stack <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> what this might
mean long term I don't know, but if your organization decides to move
platforms then the repository won't be going with you.</p>
<p>The answer from the other two organizations as to what could go horribly
wrong, was 'not too much' <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> at least
that was my reading of the answer. My summary is that with ePrints,
Dspace and Fedora commons there are enough users that if the central
organizations crumbled or gave up then someone would invent a new one.</p>
<p>But I reckon the best thing that repository managers can do is get
familiar with the ways you can import and export data while intoning to
themselves <a href="https://or09.library.gatech.edu/general95.php">Permanent Objects, Disposable
Systems</a>.</p>
<h1><span id="id3"></span><!--id3--></a>Papers and posters</h1>
<p>At OR07 the reviewers didn't think that my proposed presentation about
dragging repositories onto Web 2.0 was worth scheduling but we kept
working on dragging repositories from Web 0.5 collections of PDF into
the twentieth century (stay tuned for the twenty-first). This time, I
was able to put all the stuff I did for the conference straight into
ePrints. Each item was authored in ICE, in OpenOffice.org, (although I
could have used Microsoft Word) with an embedded slide-show. Even my
<a href="http://eprints.usq.edu.au/5258/">poster</a> had an <a href="http://eprints.usq.edu.au/5258/1/fascinator_poster.slide.htm">embedded
sideshow</a>,
a straight <a href="http://eprints.usq.edu.au/5258/1/fascinator_poster.htm">HTML
view</a> and
<a href="http://eprints.usq.edu.au/5258/1/fascinator_poster.pdf">PDF</a>.</p>
<p>First up Jim Downing from Cambridge and I showed off the work we did
with our teams on the <a href="http://eprints.usq.edu.au/5248/">ICE-TheOREM
project</a>. Not only were we able to show
a thesis going onto the web in HTML as well as the dreaded PDF, it had
granular chapter-level embargo, and we were fully buzzword compliant,
with <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/ore/">ORE</a> and
<a href="http://swordapp.org/">SWORD</a> built in. And for the first time we made
our work available as a ready-to run virtual machine, a few copies of
which I handed out. We'll definitely do more of that, and keep updating
our machine with all the software we work with <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> at the moment it runs
<a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/">ICE</a>, <a href="http://eprints.org/">ePrints</a> and <a href="http://fascinator.usq.edu.au/">The
Fascinator</a>, but I'd love to see DSpace
and OJS and Moodle on there as well all integrated.</p>
<p>I gave a <a href="http://eprints.usq.edu.au/5259/">presentation on The
Fascinator</a> in the Fedora user group
stream (great rooms with power at every seat) which was gratifyingly
well attended.</p>
<p>And there was the <a href="http://eprints.usq.edu.au/5258/">poster</a>, which I
supplemented with a metaphor <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> a
collection of 40mm &amp; 50mm PVC waste pipe and various connectors. David
Flanders used it to build a data grid which included a pipe going
straight to repository hell a place he has apparently spent a fair bit
of time drinking microbrew with too much malt. The idea was to drive the
point that we want to make research data plumbing as easy as PCV pipe
network engineering. Here I am spruiking the poster with a fistful of
PVC.</p>
<p><a name="graphics1"></a><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/m57ccafd7-184x276.jpg" alt="graphics1" /></p>
<p>At time of writing there are a couple of minor usability issues with the
HTML-in-ePrints approach which I'm sure will be fixed soon.</p>
<h1><span id="id4"></span><!--id4--></a>Microsoft workshop</h1>
<p>I attended Microsoft's workshop on their growing set of academic tools.
I'll reserve judgment on the new Zentity repostiory, but I am very, very
pleased to see Microsoft Research working on academic workflows. As part
of that, the idea of building HTML conversion into repository deposit
tools is getting a serious airing in the repository community and I'm
very pleased about that. More after my visit to MS Research tomorrow. (I
have already spent a little time in Seattle with <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/exscientia/">Pablo
Fernicola</a>, wandering in the
sculpture garden and talking in general about academic computing).</p>
<h1><span id="id5"></span><!--id5--></a>Judging the competition</h1>
<p>The final thing to mention is the Developer Challenge, run by the
unstoppable David Flanders (I was going to say indefatigable but I can't
spell that) with Rachael Rodenmayer assisting. This was judged by a team
of five based on five minute screencasts. There were some good ideas in
there, in a field that spanned entire repository developments that were
already done to small prototypes. <a href="http://dev8d.jiscinvolve.org/2009/05/20/repochallenge-winners/">Read
about</a><a href="http://dev8d.jiscinvolve.org/2009/05/20/repochallenge-winners/">the
winners at the JISC
site</a>.</p>
<p>First place went to Tim Donohue's Mention It, which is a kind of
trackback mechanism for repositories, the kind of thing that should
drive repository deposits by being useful, as opposed to the kind of
thing that tries to load up repositories by forging bigger shovels to,
you know, shovel more stuff in.</p>
<p>Second place went to an astoundingly useful, clever idea from Rebecca
Koesar, which was to turn the Fedora repository into a filesystem with
her FedoraFS. The demo will appeal to geeks, shows how you can use
ordinary system calls to do stuff to the repository. Lots of potential
here and I hope she is able to set it free for download. The ePrints
team could use it to stick Fedora under ePrints, even (although with
their new modular storage layer it's going to be easy to do that anyway
<span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> I bet there's a a Fedora layer
before OR10).</p>
<p>One of my favourites was the ePrints app store, having just waited
several months to get new code into our ePrints to support ICE
integration I welcome the idea of a central store that makes it easy for
repository managers to drop in new modules but other wiser judges
pointed out some of the risks. I think calling it an app store is a bit
of stretch, but something like the WordPress plugin mechanism would be
very welcome in the repository world, with the proviso that managers
should be encouraged to test everything in a sandbox, then a formal test
environment, then think very hard before turning on any new plugin.</p>
<p>While we saw some interesting stuff, I think that we could probably
break this challenge into two bits <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span>
one prize for development pre-conference that could be tied-to and
judged alongside poster presentations and another for in-conference
collaboration, with development focused on a set of challenges decided
before hand. There should be two tiers, one small set of prizes for
well-specified small challenges to address and bigger prizes for rising
the challenge. That's what I think anyway.</p>
<h1><span id="id6"></span><!--id6--></a>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Good conference. Good venue apart from a lack of power points (no lack
of PowerPoints unfortunately) in the main venue. I was pleased to be
showing off HTML in ePrints at last, and have ICE in production as an
eResearch workflow tool. I think the repository world is making a
welcome move to (re)embracing the idea of <a href="http://www.smallpieces.com/">small pieces loosely
joined</a>.</p>

<p>At <a href="http://usq.edu.au/">USQ</a> here has recently been <strong>a fair bit of talk
about Intellectual Property (IP)</strong> in relation to our distance education
practice at USQ, for reasons I can't and won't go into.</p>
<p>Every time I hear someone say 'protect our IP' in a meeting I keep
thinking of Richard M. Stallman's famous <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/not-ipr.html">disapproval of the
term</a>. He argues that IP is
a misleading catch-all for a series of different legal constructs,
citing copyright, patents and trademarks as distinct legal systems with
very different characteristics.</p>
<p>In order to get this 'IP' straight in my mind I thought I'd apply
Stallman's approach and have a <strong>look at the different dimensions of
IP</strong> in our distance education enterprise. I reached the conclusion that
what people are really talking about is protecting a number of things
that are not actually really Intellectual Property in any meaningful
sense. What they want to protect, I think, is knowledge that's held by
our staff and enabled by our systems. That is what helps us keep or grow
our market share and revenue. I'll go through my reasoning.</p>
<p>There's a government site called IP Australia which has a <a href="http://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/ip/introduction.shtml">longer list
of constructs</a> than
Stallman's three:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="Strong_20_Emphasis">Intellectual property</span>
represents the property of your mind or intellect. In business terms,
this also means your proprietary knowledge.</p>
<p>Types of IP:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/ip/patents.shtml">patents</a> for new
or improved products or processes;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/ip/trademarks.shtml">trade marks</a>
for letters, words, phrases, sounds, smells, shapes, logos,
pictures, aspects of packaging or a combination of these, to
distinguish the goods and services of one trader from those of
another;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/ip/designs.shtml">designs</a> for the
shape or appearance of manufactured goods;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/ip/copyright.shtml">copyright</a> for
original material in literary, artistic, dramatic or musical
works, films, broadcasts, multimedia and computer programs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/ip/circuits.shtml">circuit layout
rights</a> for the
three-dimensional configuration of electronic circuits in
integrated circuit products or layout designs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/ip/plantbreeders.shtml">plant breeder's
rights</a> for
new plant varieties; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/ip/confidentiality.shtml">confidentiality/trade
secrets</a>
including know-how and other confidential or proprietary
information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If we look at the way we run our distance education, then one kind of
'IP' stands out. Copyright. Trademark is relevant to how we use the USQ
brand but hardly the biggest issue. The other thing we need to look at
is this <a href="http://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/ip/confidentiality.shtml">trade
secrets</a> thing.
I'll come back to that.</p>
<p>There are two main areas where I think copyright might be relevant:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Copyright in our courseware.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Copyright in any materials which we use to support delivery of
educational services.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Though given that we not only teach, but teach <em>teachers</em> I guess the
lines between those are somewhat blurry.</p>
<p>[Update: As soon as I posted this I realized there is a huge third
category <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> copyright in
learner-contributed material. If we wanted to be like FaceBook we could
assert copyright over that but I don't think we would, would we?]</p>
<p>I have <a href="http://ptsefton.com/2009/05/05/three-big-hairy-audacious-goals-for-an-open-usq.htm">argued this
week</a>
that one way to get benefit from our copyright is to license our
materials under a creative commons license and let people use and adapt
them, extending our commitment to Open Courseware. One thing I forgot to
do was to point to USQ's strategy:</p>
<blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Our 2020 Vision:</p>
<p>To be recognised as a world leader in open and flexible higher
education.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, in the business of delivering distance education we want to be open.
How does this fit with 'protecting our IP'?</p>
<p>Apart from copyright and the trademark in our logo what is there left?
Do we argue plant breeding rights because we are planting seeds of
knowledge in learner's brains? Patents on our teaching methods? Circuit
layout rights for the computers we have soldered up to deliver our
courseware?</p>
<p>Well, no.</p>
<p>We're left with <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span><a href="http://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/ip/confidentiality.shtml">confidentiality/trade
secrets</a>
including know-how and other confidential or proprietary
information<span class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>. The key phrase here is
<em>know-how</em>, as in Knowledge. As in Knowledge Management. But you know
what? USQ's know-how is no secret. This is not a factory where we can
insist that certain processes remain confidential and craft employment
agreements to that end. In fact one of our core values is <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>free intellectual inquiry<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> which sounds like something Richard
Stallman would like.</p>
<p>Not only do we offer courses in flexible delivery but we have to
document our processes
for<a href="http://www.auqa.edu.au/aboutauqa/mission/">AUQA</a> audits. We <a href="http://eprints.usq.edu.au/view/for08/13.html">publish
research</a> on how we do it
. And there's a constant flow of staff in and out of universities. As
far as I know there is nothing in our education practice that could be
considered a trade secret for which we would have legal protection.</p>
<p>So I have reached the conclusion that we do need to talk about copyright
in our course materials. If we do that then we can think more clearly
about how to best exploit it. For copyright the means for exploitation
is via a license. Traditionally the license is implicitly granted to
students who enroll, but what happens to the printed courseware or the
CDs when they finish? The books are out there in the second hand shops
of Toowoomba and presumably the rest of the globe with a standard
copyright notice that forbids reproduction without permission. There is
no license to say that another university could not put the thing in
their library and use it in a course. But that's another conversation.</p>
<p>The other issue is not, as far as I can tell, IP-related in the real
sense of the term. It is to do with <em>know-how</em> but not secret,
confidential know-how. It's <strong>common or garden knowledge</strong>, like you get
in any practitioner. The challenge is to maintain our education engine
when parts of it keep walking out the door, and new parts with a
different shape walk in to replace them, and the parts are redesigning
the engine while it runs. That's much more challenging that threatening
to sue somebody.</p>
<p>To finish up, I'd like to note that I think Richard Stallman is bang-on
when he discourages use of the term <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>IP<span class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>.
Unpicking what it means for USQ has been an instructive exercise for me.
I think that if we want to improve our student recruitment and retention
and not have learners go elsewhere, then <strong>referring to the way we do
things as <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>IP<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> is not helpful</strong>. The danger in using
the phrase 'protect our IP' is that it encourages a world view that
somehow we have a 'property' other than copyright that we can guard
against theft, or profit from in direct way. Knowledge is not property
and you can't 'protect' it. People have to construct it for themselves.
People are not property either in Queensland, yet, but you can attract,
protect and encourage them.</p>
<p>Which reminds me, I remember at my first job interview at USQ telling
the panel that my ambition was to become CKO <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> that's Chief Knowledge Officer. We still
don't seem to have one of those.</p>

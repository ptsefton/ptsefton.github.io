<p>This week at the <a href="www.usq.edu.au/adfi">Australian Digital Futures
Institute</a> we're taking a look at ICE: the
<a href="ice.usq.edu.au/">Integrated Content Environment</a>, an open source
software system which is now part of the core infrastructure at USQ.</p>
<p>The ADFI team are spending all week exploring new stuff and considering
what ICE 3 might look like and how it might fit with or merge with our
other project, <a href="fascinator.usq.edu.au/desktop/desktop.htm">The
Fascinator</a>.</p>
<p>The week kicked off with a couple of sessions with the USQ community.
The first session was by invitation, we asked a number of USQ staff who
have engaged with ICE over the last few years along, including some who
have been vocal critics. The second session was an open-invitation ADFI
event. In both cases we went through this agenda:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How did we get here? (and what did we learn?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your concerns</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What should we do next?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Bron Chandler has <a href="ice.usq.edu.au/blog/2009/11/23/ice-the-future.html">summarised some of the points
already</a>, It's half
way through the week now and I have been jotting down my thoughts in
this post since Monday. This is a bit long winded, but I hope it is a
useful record of some of the lessons learned from the last few years of
content-creation systems at USQ. It's on my blog, so it's my opinion,
comments are welcome to expand, clarify, correct or argue.</p>
<p>Remember that USQ is a distance education-specialist and produces lots
of courseware, book-length study materials that are delivered in
print/PDF and/or HTML to thousands of students. Teaching and learning is
not all about courseware, of course, but courseware is a big part of
what we do, and that's what ICE was developed for.</p>
<h1><span id="id1"></span><!--id1--></a>History</h1>
<h2><span id="id2"></span><!--id2--></a>FrameMaker</h2>
<p>Adobe FrameMaker has been used since the 1990s at USQ to produce
courseware for print. It's still used for some print-only courses
(largely ones with lots of maths I think). The problem with our use of
FrameMaker is all the manual steps involved. Authors submit manuscripts
in Word, these are converted to Frame by operators, largely by hand, and
then proofing is done by the academics in Word with track changes, or on
paper with corrections. Staff in Electronic Publishing Services then
have to update the Frame documents change-by-change. This legacy process
is being phased out, but these things take time.</p>
<p>USQ has never had a fully automated web-conversion process for
FrameMaker documents although there have been a couple of attempts, and
there is now a process for converting to ICE in a semi-automated way. In
a decidedly un-automated process from 1999 or so until 2003-ish USQ used
to send FrameMaker documents over to NextEd at the USQ Toowoomba campus
to have courses converted to HTML by hand. This was a process which I
recall costing circa $5000 US per course payable every semester,
because of the almost complete lack of automation they had to be redone
with each offering. Apparently some of the HTML courses from the NextEd
days are still extant and being maintained using DreamWeaver and the
like.</p>
<p>Bron Chandler and Ron Ward and I from the current ADFI team all worked
for NextEd, and we still go to the support-group meetings from time to
time but I think we're getting better.</p>
<p>At NextEd I devised a word-processor based publishing system built
around FrameMaker which would have slashed the cost of producing courses
for both print and HTML at USQ. The system used Frame's structured
editing mode using XHTML as a document model, so you could produce high
quality print documents and export them straight to the web <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> and because it used styles in FrameMaker
you could import word processing documents and have FrameMaker
automatically add structure. NextEd got a pilot system up in a few
weeks, with help from <a href="allette.com.au/">Allette Systems</a>. I thought it
was rather a good idea but USQ was not interested in that, or our other
publishing system the CPS, because they had other plans, in the form of
an XML system.</p>
<h2><strong><span id="id3"></span><!--id3--></a>Lessons learned?</strong></h2>
<p>I think it was pretty broadly recognised that all the manual work
involved in producing courseware this way was not sustainable and not
sensible which is why USQ tried to build an XML publishing system. The
main lesson here is that systems change can take a long time in a
university and document conversion is always slow and expensive, which
is why we still have some FrameMaker documents.</p>
<h2><span id="id4"></span><!--id4--></a>LaTeX</h2>
<p>Before looking at the XML world, though, there's another legacy system,
LaTeX.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Used in some technical disciplines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No universal web conversion (really, there isn't).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There's not a whole lot to say about this, the people who know how to
use it continue to do so to produce courseware, and it continues to make
no inroads into other disciplines, I hear, though, that in engineering
they are starting to get new staff who don't know LaTeX. The problem is
that Word and OpenOffice.org are not great when it comes to very large
amounts of Maths, and ICE uses OpenOffice.org to make PDF, which is a
bit buggy for maths so there is still a place for LaTeX, even if it is
embedding LaTeX in word processing documents and automatically rendering
the maths at least until further investments are made in ICE to improve
its MathML support. USQ needs to work this out.</p>
<p>Participants in the sessions this week emphasised some of the good
points of LaTeX:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>BibTex referencing is vastly superior to anything else, we heard.
(I'm not an expert but I believe (via Bruce Darcus) if this is true
it is only so for some scientific disciplines. ICE works with the
university supported EndNote and with the open source Zotero).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LaTex's rendering is better than we produce using ICE/FrameMaker.
(Certainly true for maths, probably not that important for most of
the rest of what we do <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> but
even if you can produce PDF with links is that enough? For web use
I'd like to see more usable fluid materials like the stuff we did in
ICE-TheOREM with live, interactive chemical models embedded in web
pages, or interactive maps for documents with geographical
references, easy in HTML and not possible in PDF.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We had a follow-up meeting about LaTeX (and online document editors,
more of which later) and reached the conclusion that ICE might be able
to help manage LaTeX files and bundle them as courses, if communities of
users could agree on which LaTeX stlyes or macros to use. Some people
insist that for maths-heavy courseware the only practical delivery
medium is PDF.</p>
<h2><span id="id5"></span><!--id5--></a><strong>Lessons?</strong></h2>
<p>We've learned that where a community is using a tool that meets their
requirements it is best to leave them to it. Apparently, though there is
pressure on some of the LaTeX users to use ICE as per USQ policy. Me, I
think the policy should be based on performance outcomes not mandating
how people should achieve the outcomes. I'd love to see a
competitor/successor to ICE emerge from someone who's a bit feral and
won't use the corporate tools (but it aint going to be LaTeX-based).</p>
<h2><span id="id6"></span><!--id6--></a>GOOD</h2>
<p>The GOOD system (Generic Online Offline Delivery) was USQ's was a very
big, complicated bespoke XML system which never realised its claimed
potential. The idea was to build a semantically aware highly structured
courseware production system.</p>
<p>There were several issues with GOOD:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Converting content from FrameMaker was a very <strong>costly, slow
process.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Despite the best efforts of the team to design the one true Document
Type Definition (a DTD was an ancient kind of document schema they
had back in the twentieth century) for USQ courseware, there was
<strong>exception after exception</strong> as more disciplines came on board and
wanted different conventions, referencing systems, extensions to the
table model and so on and so on, with every discussion ending up in
a big meeting to see whether a change was needed. Being a university
we didn't count the cost of those meetings, but I bet it added up,
let alone the cost of all the changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was slow to render documents, so changes like sorting out
pagination or fixing typos were very painful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But the biggest issue was that <strong>almost none of the lecturers used
it, see below</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="id8"></span><!--id8--></a><strong>Lessons?</strong></h3>
<p>There were lots of things that USQ should remember from the GOOD
experience, most of which were well understood in the XML/SGML community
before the project started, but there's nothing like experiencing these
things for yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Top-down mandating of system is risky</strong>, particularly if the
people you're telling what to do are academics in an Australian
university. They're not process workers who will take orders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Don't build a big system without sorting out basic issues</strong> like
what editor you are going to use and testing to see whether the user
community will be able to use it and actually do so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The system produced HTML and PDF from the same source document
alright but then so did the demo system we built at NextEd using
FrameMaker at about 100^th^ of the cost. I think maybe GOOD would
have had more traction i<strong>f all that semantic markup had been used
to better effect</strong>, so people could see the point of the extra work
and cost involved. When I joined USQ I worked with the GOOD team
(particularity Oliver Lucido who now works with us in ADFI) to demo
some of the potential but our proposals never made it into the
learning management system which the students used.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="id10"></span><!--id10--></a>CPS</h2>
<p>The NextEd Continuous Publishing System was my baby at NextEd, sponsored
by another current USQer Cameron Loudon who ran the conversion team. It
was a word processor based HTML publishing system which many of our
clients used and which was used for the company intranet. But even when
customers didn't fully embrace it for courseware, we were able to use it
internally to dramatically cut costs.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Server based like ICE server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Used an earlier version of ICE templates (inherited from Standards
Australia where I helped set them up for writing standards).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No print output.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Banned at USQ's Distance and e-Learning Centre. (True, even though
there was a small user community who liked it, and it was open
source it was considered a risk to use. I think one of the issues
was whether the open source code was truly clean-room open, and then
there was the GOOD system with which the CPS competed (except for
the lack of print output)).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="id12"></span><!--id12--></a><strong>Lessons</strong>?</h3>
<p>The CPS worked pretty well. Ron Ward did most of the work on the later
versions, and together we learned a lot about modern software
development and how to keep things as simple as possible. For example
lots of the features we thought we needed it turned out we didn't and
even with the simplest possible model we could think of for
document-reuse across semesters it was too hard for most users to get
their heads around.</p>
<p>It was eventually made open source, but too late, meaning that all that
work died with most of NextEd's business. I resolved that if I worked on
software for other people again I would either (a) get paid substantial
amounts of money or (b) get to release the software under an open source
license so I could build on it in future, never mind the other potential
benefits of open source software.</p>
<p>The big thing that I miss about CPS which is so far not present in ICE
is that it was very much driven by metadata, which means that courses
self-assembled as you uploaded and described parts of a course. This is
an area we are exploring with our
ICE/<a href="fascinator.usq.edu.au/">Fascinator</a> mashup which we hope will be
used to serve all the universities policies and procedures in a faceted,
browse/search interface before too long.</p>
<h2><span id="id13"></span><!--id13--></a>ICE</h2>
<p>Regulars here probably know more than they want to about ICE and you can
read about it on the website, and in various papers (Sefton et al. 2009;
Sefton 2006; Sefton 2007).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Originally called GOOD-lite (2004) for (internal) marketing reasons
and changed immediately to The Integrated Courseware Environment for
(external) marketing reasons. (Then we changed Courseware to Content
to go after a grant.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Approved within DeC without the benefit of the kind of USQ
governance we now have.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grew organically from a user-base of one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Core system in 2009.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="id15"></span><!--id15--></a>Lessons?</h3>
<p>Lots of lessons, but we're still working out what they are. The big ones
for me are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Trying to build a replicated version controlled content management
system as well as the core ICE function which was to make HTML and
PDF courseware from word-processing files was a big mistake, cost us
a lot for limited benefit. My fault, I think for getting carried
away with <a href="www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2008/05/01.html">architectural
space-travel</a>. We're
going to see if we can get away without using Subversion or anything
remotely like it for future versions and focus on the things that
ICE does that no other system does, mainly having good generic word
processing templates and turning them into HTML. Yes it is strange
that no other open system does this but no, we don't know of
anything comparable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The agile, organic approach worked well to make the actual software
but because we started the project under local governance, just
before a big project to centralise uni IT services, by the time it
was ready to roll out there was a whole new governance framework in
place and it took longer than it should to navigate that. Future
projects need to move into core mode much more smoothly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1><span id="id17"></span><!--id17--></a>Future directions?</h1>
<p>I put up a slide for discussion with some bullet points, some brief
notes here on each point:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Concept Maps? (<a href="ice.usq.edu.au/blog/2009/11/25/ice-concept-maps.html">Bron's
summary</a>)</strong></p>
<p>Mark Phythian and co (Phythian &amp; Das Gupta 2008) have been trialling
Concept Maps as a learning and teaching aid. Mark started by
wondering if Concept Maps could provide a navigation aid for
courses, then started looking at how they might help learners. We
had a meeting on Tuesday which affirmed that ADFI will keep helping
with this line of research, with a view to building open tools for
the use of concept maps in learning, teaching and research as
indicated by ongoing evaluations like Mark has been doing.</p>
<p>We also heard about Mind Maps (don't get me started on that one) and
something called Argument Maps which were new to me . Duncan is
exploring how <a href="www.aus-e-lit.net/%5C">work on Aus-e-Lit</a> might be
used in our tools to build concept-map-like navigation or
aggregation in our tools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Efficiency:</strong></p>
<p>There were a few points that came down to ICE efficiency and
performance; there are already processes under way to make ICE more
responsive by getting some of the large video content out of it and
into more suitable repositories, building towards university-wide
media and courseware repository and discovery services. ADFI may
have a role to play in developing some of this infrastructure, and
we are gearing up to build and pilot some software along these lines
in 2010.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Media repository?</strong></p>
<p>Yep, we know we need it and there are people looking at this. It
is clear that we need some kind of repository of course content
to remember what we served up to students; Bron Chandler is
looking at the new version (2) of the Moodle learning management
system to see how repository-like it is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Drop versioning from ICE?</strong></p>
<p>It seems that the versioning is not one of ICE's most used
features and people would be happy to sacrifice it for extra
speed. Some of the maths and computing people would lament the
loss of subversion, but I figure they know how to type:
<code>svn add *; svn commit -m 'Finished for semester one!'</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Syncing?</strong></p>
<p>Ditto.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>GoogleDocs and other online editors?</strong></p>
<p>We had a group looking at online editors today. Stijn Dekeyser is
particularly interested in either working with Google Docs and its
APIs to do some ICE integration, or better yet designing a
collaborative structured semantically aware editor. The latter
sounds fun, but it would be a huge project and I think would be well
beyond us without a very strong partner. We will look at
opportunities for work in this area where we can. Via Anna Gerber I
got a tip to look at Google Docs Base editor which uses the Google
Docs APIs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="twitter.com/AnnaGerber"><span
class="Strong_20_Emphasis">AnnaGerber</span></a>

<p>@<a href="twitter.com/ptsefton">ptsefton</a> Have you seen Google Docs Base
Editor? <a href="code.google.com/p/gdbe/">code.google.com/p/gdbe/</a></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Google Wave (no)</strong></p>
<p>See my <a href="ptsefton.com/2009/11/17/wave-as-a-scholarly-document-editor-not-promising-at-this-stage.htm">recent
critique</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>More LaTeX support?</strong></p>
<p>I wrote about this above. If the LaTeX users can organise
themselves, there might be a case for extending ICE's limited
support for LaTeX to help with the course-management side of things.
Look, if someone is telling a mathematician to dump LaTeX and use
Word or openoffice.org just because university policy is to 'use
ICE' then I think that's wrong and I'm happy to help them fight
their case. But I'm also going to fight against everyone who wants
to just put PDF on the web and not take advantage of the web in
every possible way, so I support PDF-only courses only where they
are so maths-heavy there is no other practical way to deliver them
right now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ebook delivery</strong></p>
<p>I have been using and loving an ebook reader on my android phone,
which experience I will go into in more detail soon. There was
interest in adding eBook publishing to ICE from both the library,
where ex RUBRIC colleague Alison Hunter emphasised the importance of
being able to deliver electronic books as part of the library of the
future and from the Learning and Teaching Support Unit, where
Michael Sankey thought eBook delivery would be important for open
educational resources. (Which reminds me, need to make some more
<a href="ptsefton.com/2009/05/05/three-big-hairy-audacious-goals-for-an-open-usq.htm">noise about Open Courseware and other open things we could be
doing</a>.)</p>
<p>Linda Octalina and Cynthia Wong got ICE packaging books in EPUB
format in less than a day and we're ironing out bugs and testing in
Stanza on the iPhone and Aldiko on Android. When that's done we will
had the plugin over to Michael at LTSU and see if we can get some
trials going.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SiteCore/SharePoint?</strong></p>
<p>These are the corporate web CMS and intranet systems. It would be
nice if they could understand ICE documents; we're not going to
tackle these this week, but I hope that USQ gets around to it one
day. Given that we can produce high-quality HTML pages for courses
from the tool that most people use for documents authoring (MS Word)
it seems a pity not to extend that to more corporate documents.
There is the forthcoming policies and procedure site which will show
just how much <strong>better ICE documents are</strong> than standard ad-hoc
unstlyed word documents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Moodle tie-in?</strong></p>
<p>This is a big one, for which we don't have a lot of data yet. Bron
chandler is investigating Moodle 2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Theses?</strong></p>
<p>Nothing much to report since
<a href="ptsefton.com/2009/08/24/ice-for-theses-thesice-where-we-are-we-up-to.htm">August,</a>
but I hope to talk more with people at ANU about theses, as I write
this my honours thesis is not function in ePub format, possibly
because the title it too long: <em>MAKING PLANS FOR NIGEL: Defining
interfaces between computational representations of linguistic
structure and output systems: Adding intonation, punctuation and
typography systems to the PENMAN system.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Journals (OJS)?</strong></p>
<p>There's a project to get OJS up at USQ, and we have had a long
running dialogue with the PKP folks about ICE integration, but
nothing new to report at this stage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Annotations!!</strong></p>
<p>There was strong support for taking the kind of in-document
in-browser annotation we have in ICE as an authoring service and
making it more generally available. Ron Ward is working with Duncan
Dickinson to see if we can get the open
<a href="metadata.net/sfprojects/dannotate.html">Dannotate</a> system going in
our systems with a view to having rich discussions in-context as
part of the teaching and learning process. We are keen to get
annotations going for eResearch too, for peer review, and for public
participation in research in our work with the Public Memory
Research Centre.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Various contributions about potential functionality from Michael
Sankey (thanks!): syndication of audio and video content from
YouTube, Facebook, inline quizzes, infopath/Sharepoint forms
integration. Implementation of a global glossary and integration
with and Mahara.</p>
<p>We're going to find out more about Mahara and how we might bridge
between it and ICE and media repositories and Eprints and our
eReserve system and library catalogue and so on.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1><span id="id19"></span><!--id19--></a>Working parties</h1>
<p>And we have 4 mini 'sprint' developments/investigation happening in the
tech team this week. These are designed to explore some of the many
things that were brought up by our colleagues where we think we can get
something to show quickly that will advance ICE significantly:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Annotations:</strong> Ron Ward &amp; Duncan Dickinson. The point here is to
look for generic annotation services for academia covering comment,
discussion, notes for personal use, peer review, marking and so on,
using a common web based system across multiple web applications.
The basis for this is
<a href="metadata.net/sfprojects/dannotate.html">Dannotate,</a> to which we are
adding some user-interface tweaks</p>
</li>

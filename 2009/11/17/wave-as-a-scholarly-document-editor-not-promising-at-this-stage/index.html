<p>[Update 2009-11-18: fixed links that were broken by The Fascinator]
I have had a couple of <a href="http://ptsefton.com/ptsefton/ptsefton+googlewave">looks at Google Wave here on this
blog</a>, initially
thinking about whether it can be used to create academic documents.</p>
<p>At this stage it <strong>doesn't look promising for document collaboration on
scholarly works to me</strong>, although I will keep monitoring developments.
In the near future I'll write about whether wave could be useful for a
annotation, commenting and marking in the academic space. Can we use it
for thesis examination, peer review, assignment marking, thesis
supervision and so on? Could you move around a wave in the Open Journal
Systems, for example?</p>
<p>For now, here's a summary of what I've found out so far, apart from the
fact that it's still running at glacier-speed and is thus completely
unusable, even for small waves.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Blips and wavelets are time-ordered.</strong> Not intrinsically a bad
thing, particularly for keeping track of conversations but not what
you want in an editing application. This means that you can't use
Wave like an outliner, or a usable document editor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While there is talk of 'XML documents' in the <a href="http://www.waveprotocol.org/whitepapers/operational-transform">whitepapers
etc</a>,
<strong>a wave document in the current implementation is apparently a
series of lines of text</strong>. All formatting and what you might think
of as structure, such as whether something is a heading or not, is
considered an annotation. When the Google Wave client sends stuff to
a robot for processing, there are no XML elements there at all, just
line-breaks like this; <code>\n</code>. (I could be missing something here, but
as far as I can tell paragraph level formatting like headings or
list items are not sent to robots.)</p>
<p>This seems to be at odds with this example from the white paper on
OT (Operational Transformation):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Wave, every 16-bit Unicode code unit (as used in javascript,
JSON, and Java strings), start tag or end tag in an XML document
is called an item. Gaps between items are called positions.
Position 0 is before the first item. A document operation can
contain mutations that reference positions. For example, a &quot;Skip&quot;
mutation specifies how many positions to skip ahead in the XML
document before applying the next mutation.</p>
<p><a name="graphics1"><!-- --></a><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/wave3_files5d344c60.png.png" alt="graphics1"></p>
<p>Wave document operations also support annotations. An annotation
is some meta-data associated with an item range, i.e. a start
position and an end position. This is particularly useful for
describing text formatting and spelling suggestions, as it does
not unecessarily complicate the underlying XML document format.</p>
<p><a name="graphics2"><!-- --></a><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/wave3_filesc79b91f.png.png" alt="graphics2"></p>
<p><a href="http://www.waveprotocol.org/whitepapers/operational-transform">www.waveprotocol.org/whitepapers/operational-transform</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The formatting here overlaps in a very un-XML way. Again, there's
nothing intrinsically wrong with this approach, the tree-hierarchy
in XML is not a natural property of language, merely a convenience
for machine processing. But when it says in the white paper this
does not <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>unnecessarily
complicate the underlying XML document format<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> I'd say it just moves that
complication elsewhere. For example, in a document editor
application you'd want to be able to serialise those overlapping
annotations as XML / HTML, which is going to be complicated. And
what if I add another annotation <code>style/color=”blue”</code> at positions
<code>2 to 4</code>? Does <code>b</code> go purple?</p>
<p>As I said before, <a href="http://ptsefton.com/2009/11/02/a-bit-more-on-wave-as-a-scholarly-html-editor.htm">in my second post on Wave as a scholarly HTML
editor</a>,
it's disappointing to see such silly examples of documents in the
Wave documentation, like this from the <a href="http://www.waveprotocol.org/draft-protocol-specs/wave-conversation-model">Draft Protocol Spec for the
Google Wave Conversation
Model</a>
, which should not be broken into lines at all:</p>
<p><body></p>
<p><line></line>There is a theory which states that if ever anybody</p>
<p><line></line>discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it</p>
<p><line></line>is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by</p>
<p><line></line>something even more bizarre and inexplicable. There is another</p>
<p><line></line>theory which states that this has already happened.</p>

<h1> 
The path to developer happiness: Unit testing in Python &amp; XSLT 
</h1>
<h2>2009-02-12 </h2>

<div>
<div class="page-toc">
</div>
<div>
<p>When David Flanders asked me what I'd like to talk about at the
Developer Happiness Days, I thought I could do something on XSLT <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> which turns out to be not that much of a
hot topic <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> I ended up giving a
short talk on XSLT and where to use it and where to not use it, and
contributing to the Python day. In both cases I pushed the idea that
beginners should start with test-first unit testing.</p>
<p>In the Python day we had a discussion about Integrated Development
Environments and concluded that there is no one way, but Eclipse does
seem to be popular (Ron Ward and I loathe it but others in our team use
it happily). Someone pointed out to me that Eclipse is really good for
multi-language development.</p>
<p>I did a quick demo of
<a href="http://docs.python.org/library/doctest.html">Doctest</a> which is a way of
embedding unit tests in documentation.</p>
<p>What's a unit test?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming">computer
programming</a>,
<strong>unit testing</strong> is a software design and development method where the
programmer verifies that individual units of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code">source
code</a> are working properly.
A unit is the smallest testable part of an application. In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming">procedural
programming</a> a
unit may be an individual program, function, procedure, etc., while in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">object-oriented
programming</a>,
the smallest unit is a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_%28computer_science%29">method</a>,
which may belong to a base/super class, abstract class or
derived/child class.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>My contribution was a hello world program where the testable bit was a
'hi' function.</p>
<p>(And we didn't really say this but everyone I spoke to was in favour of
developing with Unix based OS, meaning OS X or Linux (Ubuntu is the
default now). If you're stuck with Windows then get some virtualization
going.)</p>
<p>And here are my notes for the lighting talk on XSLT:</p>
<div class="slide">
<h1>XSLT? What is it? Why would you use it?</h1>
<p>In this talk I'd like to cover the basics of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it is?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When to use it and when not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are going to use it, how to do so without losing your mind.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>What is XSLT?</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A way of transforming XML into (almost always) another kind of XML.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>XSLT is a plot by the computer science intelligentsia to sneak Lisp
into your life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>XSLT is aggressively 'functionally' oriented (ie it's Lisp with an
even scarier syntax).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>XSLT is a standard widely available, simple way to transform data
from one format to another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>XSLT 2 is an improvement but there is a severe shortage of
implementations</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Places I have used XSLT follow.</p>
<div class="slide">
<h1>The all-encompassing XSLT CMS</h1>
<p>An entire web framework for content management. Site structure was
defined by a 'site map' which was compiled into a big XSLT stylesheet
used to process every request.</p>
<p>Do it again?</p>
<p>Emphatically no.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Rendering word processing documents into HTML</h1>
<p>Gets very complicated when trying to create hierarchical structure from
flat input.</p>
<p>Modern word processing formats have too much indirection and too much
application baggage to process with XSLT.</p>
<p>Do it again? Not until XSLT 3 :-)</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Simple data transforms</h1>
<p>Simple data transforms for mapping data from one relatively flat form to
another <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> eg EndNote references to
Dublin Core metdata.</p>
<p>Works well enough.</p>
<p>Will do it again.</p>
</div>
<h1><span id="id1"></span><!--id1--></a></h1>
<div class="slide">
<h1>If you're going to do it</h1>
<p>Test first!</p>
<p>XSLT can really mess with your mind. Start with test cases. We use
UTF-X.</p>
<p><a href="http://utf-x.sourceforge.net/">http://utf-x.sourceforge.net/</a></p>
<p>And here's a quick <a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/trac/wiki/InstallUtfx">how to get
started</a> on Ubuntu that I
worked out in my prep for dev8d.</p>
</div>
<p>Summary:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Don't overdo it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use it where the overall structure of you input and output is either
very congruent or very simple.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write tests first.</p>
</li>
</ol>

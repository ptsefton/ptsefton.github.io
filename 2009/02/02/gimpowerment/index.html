<p>At my house there lives an eight year old, who is almost certainly my
son. I came home on Wednesday to find him trying to mutilate a Pokemon
picture he'd snaffled off the web using the drawing program in
OpenOffice.org. This was not going well: a (not great) vector drawing
tool meets a bitmap image. But it does show that the Ubuntu application
menu works <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> at least he found
something graphics oriented under Applications / Graphics.</p>
<p>He and his mother asked, do we have something like Paint?</p>
<p>I thought, <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">the Gimp's</a> installed on Ubuntu by
default, but it's a bit scary, so I had a look for basic paint programs
for Linux, ending up in the Ubuntu forums as always. It's so easy to
install stuff on Ubuntu <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> I can
connect from another machine while he's playing with the web and install
stuff from the command line:</p>
<p>sudo aptitude install tuxpaint gpaint</p>
<p>Tux paint? An interface that would make even an eight year old vomit,
and no apparent way to open a file. Look at that lazy penguin which
appears to be sipping a daiquiri it could get of its arse<a href="#ftn0"><span
style="vertical-align: super;"><span
class="endnote">1</span></span></a> and find me file or two.</p>
<p><span
style="display: block"><a name="graphics1"></a><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/m4d41f69b-331x248.jpg" alt="graphics1"></span></p>
<p>GNU paint? We found the rubber (eraser) tool OK, but the lack of undo
undid that application for us.</p>
<p>I said, <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>I guess you could try the
Gimp<span class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>.</p>
<p>He did. And he had no trouble at all. He'd say <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>I want to just keep part of the
picture<span class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> and we said <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>you want a cropping tool<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>, and that was enough for him to poke
around and find what he needed. The only drama was to do with the
filesystem <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> he accidentally saved
one of his creations in the wrong place <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> but we found it.</p>
<p>I mention this because kids understand that to use a new application you
have to learn<a href="#ftn1"><span style="vertical-align: super;"><span
class="endnote">2</span></span></a> how it works and they don't have
the unreasonable expectation that it should be intuitive, whatever that
means.</p>
<p>I'm sure this is somehow relevant to eResearch and eLearning and the
work that we do on <a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/">tools</a> for same.</p>

she already knows everything.</p>

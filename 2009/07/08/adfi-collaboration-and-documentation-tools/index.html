<p><a href="http://reushle.wordpress.com/2009/06/30/hello-world/">Shirley Reushle</a>
has been beating me up<span class="T3"><span class="footnote"
style="vertical-align: super;"><a href="#ftn1" title="1     Not literally yet but she's looking like she might – she actually mimed putting her hands around my neck this morning. I think the only thing that saved me is that I'm getting a sore throat and she is afraid of catching it.">1</a></span></span>
about the mess of software and websites and stuff that we use here at
ADFI. There's <a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/">ICE</a> and Microsoft Office and
<a href="http://openoffice.org/">OpenOffice.org</a> and SharePoint (about which no
more will be said here) and <a href="http://delicious.com/">delicious</a> and the
dreaded <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> and our multiple Trac project
management sites (<a href="http://cairss.caul.edu.au/trac/">CAIRSS</a> | <a href="http://fascinator.usq.edu.au/trac">The
Fascinator</a> |
<a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/trac/report/7">ICE</a> and more) and some of us have
blogs and some of our projects have a project blog and then there's
email using the corporate Microsoft Exchange (many of us are stuck using
the feeble web client for that because of our choice of operating
system), and a few of us prefer to deal with our mail in the vastly more
efficient Google suite. We use IM, that's instant messaging, AKA chat.
Me, I talk to various team members and colleagues on MSN, Yahoo, AIM,
Google Talk and Skype. Of course, everyone should be hooked-in to a
feed-reader of some kind, although lots of people around here don't seem
to know what that is. Stay tuned if you are one of them. Really, this is
important. There's Facebook too <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span>
which doesn't seem to figure too much in our work but is useful
sometimes. Why just recently I saw two senior people chatting about how
they have this terrible problem with how to spend tens of millions of
government dollars and I was able to place a well-timed telephone call
(don't they know that's what Twitter is for?). This is not counting all
the stuff our virtual Worlds specialist, Lindy McKeown uses.</p>
<p>To help Shirley, I thought I'd sit down and do a matrix of tasks mapped
against the services you can use to get them done so she could look up
what she wanted to do and it would tell her which tools to use, only I
can't.</p>
<p>It's too hard.</p>
<p>We do have a bewildering array of things to deal with in our work at
ADFI and it takes time and practice and experience to know what to do
with them all. What I'll do here is:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Run through some thoughts about the various kinds of tools we use
and then cook-up just a few workflows that show which applications
you might choose in different situations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Following all that I'll talk a bit about what I think the future
might bring, both for us at the ADFI and more broadly. To jump
ahead, if the promise of<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_wave">Google
Wave</a> is realized then a
lot of the distinctions between communications software and document
editors and publishing systems will disappear, but I'm sure we'll
still be able to confuse ourselves.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I will follow-up with two more posts, one on how to get started with
communications tools (summary, get Google Reader and find some
professional sources, some <a href="http://www.tictocs.ac.uk/">journals</a>, some
news you want to follow, some photo albums from friends, get comfortable
with it, then get a delicious account and start sharing bookmarks with
your team, then try Twitter). The second will be about how we can bring
all these things together onto an ADFI website.</p>
<h1><span id="id1"></span><!--id1--></a>Email and when not to use it: communications tools</h1>
<p><strong>Email</strong> is obviously a big issue and everyone claims to have too much.</p>
<p>Personally I follow a variant of Merlin Mann's Inbox Zero approach
(check out the
<a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=973149761529535925">video</a> or
the <a href="http://www.43folders.com/izero">posts</a>). I try to either deal with
email the first time I read it or add it to a task list (Gmail is great
for this). Part of this is being honest about how much I can deal with
<span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> I know there's no point in letting
something that's of only peripheral interest to me sit around in my
inbox staring at me and making me feel guilty. So if can't be answered
immediately or it's not for someone who really matters like a DVC or a
customer or a key stakeholder then I bin it. The alternative is to think
<span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>I'll get around to that<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>; then surprise surprise, to not get
around to it; then to have to trawl through it later. Takes longer and
achieves nothing but increased anxiety. They key to Inbox Zero is to
turn email into action. Either that or vaporize it.</p>
<p>One of my priorities with my team is to <strong>reduce the volume of email
that needs to be managed</strong>. By managed I mean kept, and tracked beyond
the first time you read it. It's not really the total volume that
matters, it's the management overheard <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> if you can scan it and act on it it then
it is dealt with, it's the things that hang around that are a problem.
There are a couple of things for which I don't think email is a good
solution:</p>
<p>Jobs to do. Actions.
:   If there's a job for someone to do we aim to use a job ticket<span
    class="T3"><span class="footnote"
    style="vertical-align: super;"><a href="#ftn2" title="2 I can hear my staff grinding their teeth here as I have a bad habit of sending them emails about software bugs or whatever instead of taking the time to put a job ticket in our Trac system.">2</a></span></span>
in the Trac system, like <a href="http://fascinator.usq.edu.au/trac/ticket/215">this
one</a> I picked at
random. It shows work Oliver has been doing on reorganizing one of
our systems. This is much better than email, of course because it is
accessible to everyone and it's all in the server not smeared around
several inboxes. So for the techincal team it is standard practice
to convert emails into one or more Trac tickets.</p>
<p>Notification of new content
:   Another thing that's not a good use of email is to get updates from
web sites, or journals or whatever. Far better to use a feed
reader/aggregator. I am frankly surprised how little penetration
these systems have had. I won't name names but a lot of people who
we associate with don't use an aggregator to monitor what's going
on. I have Google Reader set up to watch lots of tech blogs, a few
journals, some miscellaneous blogs for fun, some friend's online
photo albums, some delicious tags, a Twitter search or two. I just
read the whole lot, river of news style, usually starting at home
around 6am but some people prefer to read by subject or by
importance with folders like 'check hourly', 'check daily' and
'check monthly'.
:   For example, I just accidentally subscribed to the forum at a
'Virtual Conference' which is being run in what seems like hundreds
of twisty little Moodle discussions, all alike and was immediately
inundated with email. I wouldn't have minded all that if it was in
Google reader where I could scan it but discussion like that does
not belong in my inbox, and there seems to be no way to subscribe
using Atom/RSS (and no I don't want to set up a rule or filter for
every subscription <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> routing
email to a folder is just a way of admitting you're not going to
read it or turn it into actions).</p>
<p>Links to look at
:   Then there's the one where someone sends a link to a web site in
email - <span class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>hey check out this cool
thing<span class="spCh spChx201d">”</span> if they just mail it then
it ends up living in several inboxes, with no guaranteed corporate
memory that it was ever sent. That's why we encourage people not to
circulate links by email but to bookmark them in delicious. On the
RUBRIC project we had the well-organized Marisa Parker bookmarking
<a href="http://delicious.com/tag/destrubric">things as they came in via
email.</a> The result is now we
don't have to go back through old mail to see what was important on
the project. (One of the problems here is that some senior people
are used to being fed stuff by email so sometimes we just have to
send stuff that way <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> some of
them even have personal assistants and such to print out the web
pages and put them in folders.)
:   Slightly better than <span style="font-style:normal; "><span
    class="T4">sending</span></span> links via email to individuals is
sending them to a managed list, for which we mostly use <strong>Google
Groups</strong> now. At least with a group people know they can delete
their copy of a posting and it will remain in the archive but it's
still not a good place to store links to websites <span
    class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> you can also appoint a delicious
user like Marisa to record stuff as it comes in (I thought you
should be able to subscribe to a feed from a Google group in Google
reader, but it doesn't seem to work at the moment).
:   Our main tags are: <a href="http://delicious.com/tag/usqadfi">usqadfi</a>for
general stuff and <a href="http://delicious.com/tag/adfisdt">adfisdt</a> for
stuff that is of interest to the software development team.</p>
<p>As I write this, in another window I see this tweet (that's a Twitter
message):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/billpollock"><span
class="Strong_20_Emphasis">billpollock</span></a>
always read email with the Reply button</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually, that sounds like bad advice, better to say <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>Always read email with a finger over the
delete button<span class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>, but not to worry,
this brings us to Twitter. Here are a few examples of how Twitter has
been useful to me and the software team:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Twitter's a good source of useful news and links if you follow
authoritative sources with a high signal to noise ratio. Take Tim
O'Reilly (the publisher). His feed is
<a href="http://twitter.com/timoreilly">here</a>. If you're on Twitter you can
follow him, or use the <a href="http://twitter.com/statuses/user_timeline/2384071.rss">RSS
feed</a>to
subscribe, just as you would to a blog, so your feed reader keeps
track of it all for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Twitter got me a <a href="http://ptsefton.com/2009/03/10/developer-happiness-and-associated-meetings.htm">trip to the Developer Happiness
days</a>
workshop in London. OK, I admit that's stretching it, because I was
known to the organizers but we had been hanging out on Twitter
talking about tech stuff and David Flanders contacted me about
coming to the event via Twitter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Twitter was useful in <a href="http://ptsefton.com/2009/03/16/the-desktop-fascinator-aka-dterrev.htm">developing the idea for and promoting The
Fascinator</a>
in conversation with Jim Richardson, Rowan Brownlee and others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At conferences now, Twitter is a really useful channel for
establishing contact <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> someone
will announce where they are and a party can coalesce. See <a href="http://delicious.com/jimrhiz/twitter+conferences">Jim
Richardson's delicious links about Twitter at
conferences</a>. See
<span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> that's Jim working as an
eResearch hub <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> using the tools
I'm talking about here. He'll drop a link to those resources in when
people start talking about an upcoming conference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can get instant advice from followers and others who happen to
pick up on keywords in a tweet. Just this week, when I bought a new
Android powered smartphone (to explore the digital future, not for
frivolous reasons), I got lots of advice from Twitter about whether
or not to buy a particular model and what apps to install on it.
Similarly, I have some generous help in working out how to rescue
some document in legacy formats from Twitter followers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It keeps the social conversation going in our team in and out of
business hours. Last weekend Bron Chandler and I were talking with
Linda Octalina about (a) not working on the weekends and (b) where
to buy laying chooks in Toowoomba. Doing this on Twitter means that
anyone in overlapping group of followers can join in, or politely
ignore us, or unsubscribe if our signal to noise ration drops too
low. If we direct the messages '@' each other then they don't spill
over into the the general feed. So a message from me starting with
@linda_octa goes to her plus our mutual followers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We're trying out Twitter with the CAIRSS service too. There is an
official<a href="https://twitter.com/caulcairss">CAIRSS account</a> that Kate
Watson and Tim McCallum use, but anyone can contribute to the
conversation by using the hashtag
<a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23caulcairss">#caulcairss</a> in their
message I can't say it's had much impact yet but we will see.</p>
<p>One of the other things we're trying with CAIRSS is aggregating activity
from different services together <a href="http://cairss.caul.edu.au/www/news_stand.htm">on the CAIRSS
site</a>. That's only part of
the story though, as that page is just taking a live feed from other
services, not actually bringing the content back into a repository at
our site. This is important, one of the issues with using Twitter is
that messages disappear, in <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2009/06/28/real-time-systems-hurting-long-term-knowledge/">Real-time systems hurting long-term
knowledge?</a>
Robert Scoble notes that Twitter and Friend Feed (which I will spare you
here because it's not a big part of how we work) are both much less
effective than blogs when it comes to persistence and retrieval, for now
anyway. Which bring us to blogs. I will pick up on this idea of
persistence at the end of this piece.</p>
<p>I think we're past the stage where we have to argue for the
effectiveness of professional blogs so I'll be brief here. This blog has
helped me to establish a small professional network. This blog was the
glue that helped me to get to the point where I could essentially invite
myself to Microsoft Research in Redmond, and <a href="http://ptsefton.com/2009/06/11/trip-report-visit-to-microsoft.htm">get away with
it</a>.
This blog is where most of the real scholarly communication I'm engaged
in goes on <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> anything that makes it
into a paper or a conference presentation is already pretty well worked
out and discussed here first. This blog talking to other blogs built the
partnership we've established with Peter Murray-Rust's group and
Cambridge.</p>
<p>Others on our team have blogs that work for them in different ways. They
can comment below if they want to spruik them.</p>
<p>Finally, chat is really useful <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> we
use it a lot over lots of different Instant Messaging services. Even if
you're sitting next to someone it is sometimes better to interrupt via a
chat session as it means they can finish the sentence they're typing or
ignore you if they're busy. I have a network of people in chat I can
call on for instant advice, and some people come to me with questions
too.</p>
<p>With collaboration tools we all have different profile. On Twitter I
tend to follow peers, people with whom I have a reasonably symmetrical
relationship, where it is likely that if I mention them in a tweet they
will see it and maybe respond, whereas Tim McCallum gets a lot from
authorities who have thousands of followers, something I use an
aggregator for <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> I would be more
inclined to
<a href="http://twitter.com/statuses/user_timeline/15736190.rss">subscribe</a> to
Tim's pick <a href="http://twitter.com/smashingmag">@smashingmag</a> in Reader than
to follow them on Twitter.</p>
<p>Just to tie this together a bit this week a real example of these
communications services in action.</p>
<p>Christiaan Kortekass from UQ tweeted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/ckortekaas"><span
class="Strong_20_Emphasis">ckortekaas</span></a>
Trying to figure out how to enable phrase stemming in Solr. Anyone
know? Eg search &quot;Andrews, K&quot; to return &quot;Andrews, K&quot; and &quot;Andrew,
Kathy&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I saw this and was just putting together an email to put him in touch
with Kent Fitch at the NLA who is a real guru this area when Christiaan
grabbed me in Google Chat and we had a quick discussion about it, and he
showed me some cool stuff they're doing with geolocating their
repository access stats. While that was happening I started an email
thread which ended up with five people on it. Christiaan was tweeting
solutions a couple of hours later. (He makes a reappearance in the
conclusion of this post).</p>
<h1><span id="id2"></span><!--id2--></a>Writing Documents</h1>
<p>Having looked at interaction-based services I will look at documents.
This is something we think a lot about, because the team at ADFI were
responsible for inventing and building <a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/">ICE</a>, so
naturally we eat our own dog food<span class="T3"><span class="footnote"
style="vertical-align: super;"><a href="#ftn3" title="3 I worked for NextEd for a while, one of the things that endeared me to the company initially was seeing Paul McKey's cutting up the cow keynote at AUSWEB 2K  where he referred to “Eating our own dog shit”. He denies it, but I swear that's what I heard. Paul is no longer just a man, he's now a brand, which you can experience for yourself .">3</a></span></span>.</p>
<p>ICE was built for making book-length courseware that can be delivered in
print and web formats from the same source, with an authoring tool that
academics will actually use. But we also use it for lots of other
things.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For websites, like the <a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/">ICE site</a>, or the
<a href="http://cairss.caul.edu.au/">CAIRSS</a> site.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For <a href="http://eprints.usq.edu.au/5248/">papers</a> and
<a href="http://eprints.usq.edu.au/5258/1/fascinator_poster.htm">posters</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For blogging. You're looking at mine now. For other examples the
<a href="http://caulcairss.wordpress.com/">CAIRSS blog</a> and the <a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/blog/2009/06/22/ice-2009-06-19.html">ICE
blog</a>.
(And <a href="http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/murrayrust/">Peter Murray Rust</a>
has joined us at his blog where he is finding lots of bugs for us.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For grant applications and other formal communications where PDF is
a good deliverable.</p>
<p>(See, I'm not anti-PDF. It's a great way to send stuff to project
board members who you just <strong>know</strong> are going to print it out <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> they'll value it much more than an
email with the same text in it, and for some people a PDF is so much
more authoritative than a web page. Don't worry, they'll retire
soon.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Others use it for the above as well as for newsletters which get mailed
around USQ.</p>
<p>The basic rule here is that everything that is going to be a 'finished'
web document or delivered as a PDF finishes up as an ICE document, but
it doesn't necessarily have to start that way. It could start in an
email, or a wiki or in Google docs.</p>
<p>For internal document we can circulate a document for comment just by
sending a link to the ICE server and people can comment inline. This
allows paragraph level annotation, which is good for general review and
for discussion. There would be more work to do to make this usable by a
broader population, allowing an author to set up an ad-hoc group or mail
an obscure URL.</p>
<p>Here is an inline comment from Shirley with a reply from me:</p>
<p><a name="graphics1"><!-- --></a><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/7283237d-554x253.jpg" alt="graphics1">\</p>
<p>Shirley is working on a reply to this document of mine.</p>
<p>Another way to collaborate is with Google Docs, which is a bit of an odd
beast. I've covered it here <a href="http://delicious.com/ptsefton/googledocs+ptsefton">several times
before</a>, mostly from
the point of view of how broken it is at basic stuff like HTML
formatting and at importing and exporting word processing documents. I
have been giving it a try this week with a post I'm writing for CAIRSS
about person-identifiers, where I want input from people elsewhere and I
ran into a really annoying issue where it would not even import the
document a plain-old OpenDocument Format document written in the latest
version of OpenOffice.org. Saved the OpenDocument as a Word doc but it
mangled a diagram. In the end I had to convert it to a bitmap. And when
I go to re-edit and post to the blog I'll have to put back in all my
styles that Google took out and put back in the original image. I used
to be worried about this, but now I think that GDocs is going to be
irrelevant, I'll talk about that at the end of this post. I think it's
pretty telling that Google Documents doesn't even support the latest
OpenOffice.org format, why would they invest in it with Wave coming?</p>
<p>But for all that, GDocs <strong>is</strong> spectacularly good at syncronous and/or
asyncronous collaborative editing. I think Google are onto something
there.</p>
<p>And then there are wikis. We have those too, because they are embedded
in Trac. We use them for project management quite intensively. I know
that Duncan Dickinson on our team is disappointed with the limitations
of the wiki system in Trac, but the really good thing about is the
integration with the other parts of the system. Wikis are inherently
flexible so you can do a lot with them. Two things we tend to do a lot
of:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Put up a project summary page with a broad outline of tasks, and
then link that to individual job tickets. See <a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/trac/wiki/TheOremIceTasks">this one for the
ICE-TheOREM
project</a> we did for
Cambridge. Those crossed off ticket numbers <a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/trac/ticket/5903">link to
tickets</a>, which in turn
<a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/trac/changeset/9945">link to changesets</a> in
our open code-base.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For teleconferences we set up a single agenda/meeting page and take
the minutes as we go. Participants can come back later and make
changes as needed, which are all tracked. This does away with the
whole minutes, agenda, voting to accept the minutes dance that used
to go on.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1><span id="id4"></span><!--id4--></a>Workflows</h1>
<p>I think the discussion above shows that the idea of a tool matrix with
what to use in every situation is unrealistic. But here are a few common
recipes for use at ADFI.</p>
<h2><span id="id5"></span><!--id5--></a>Writing a research paper using a supplied template</h2>
<p>We have used the first two of these <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> will try the third.</p>
<p>In all cases we would use a reference manager. I mention Zotero here
there are others. With Zotero you have to build the bibliography and
inline citations using just one Zotero library, but it does have
collaboration tools which are getting increasingly good. For example on
a paper we just wrote I managed references but Duncan created a lot of
them in his Zotero account and shared it. Here's <a href="http://www.zotero.org/ptsefton/items">my
account</a> <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> if you like any of those refs and you're
running Zotero in Firefox you can click to download to your own
database. (There's some kind of bug where it keeps adding duplicates, I
haven't looked into yet).</p>

</div>
<h2><span id="id6"></span><!--id6--></a>Towards a manual for a new bit of software</h2>
<p>As we write new software this is what we tend to do about documentation:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Initial how-to will be in the Trac ticket or the code the developer
writes, maybe in the form of a 'usage' output for commandline tool.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When we get someone other than the developer to test the tool there
will be a wiki page, describing, say how to install it. The tester
can fix any issues with the doco.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When we release, one of the project coordinators will paste the
wiki-generated documentation into an OpenOffice.org document in ICE
and clean it up to follow our guidelines for procedures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We publish the 'real' procedures etc on the web via ICE.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2><span id="id8"></span><!--id8--></a>A blog post like this one</h2>
<p>For substantial posts like this one, I tend to seek review from the rest
of the team, so:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I write it in OpenOffice.org,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interact a lot as I go in email, chat and Twitter,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Put it into an ICE server and get comments (or not if they are all
too busy doing real work).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When it's done I hit the Atom Pub to push it to a blog, usually
here, but if I am speaking on behalf of a project that it will go to
the relevant blog.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Track the comments on the blog and respond there.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1><span id="id10"></span><!--id10--></a>Conclusion</h1>
<p>So it's complicated integrating and moving between all these different
tools, but as I have flagged several times above, there is a potential
solution coming. If that's not Google Wave then I bet it will be
something that looks a lot like it.</p>
<p>We are working in a world where the old metaphors are still constraining
use.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We built ICE because the metaphorical typewriter that is the word
processor is not hooked up properly to the web. Yes 'web' is a
metaphor, but we all understand now that it has well and truly
transcended that metaphor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The metaphorical postal system that is email is still well and truly
mired in its own metaphor, with boxes and postmasters and so on
cropping up all over the place in the lexicon. We interact with our
metaphorical postal system via the web in 'web mail', but it's not
really of-the-web.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I said I'd come back to Christiaan. While writing this up I remembered
that yet another communications system, which they used to use at UQ, is
<a href="http://campfirenow.com/">Campfire</a>; a group chat system that provides a
'room' where developers can drop in. When we were evaluating Fez I
joined Christiaan and team at the Campfire and it was a great way to
participate in a discussion with a whole team. While I was asking about
how the software worked they were talking about the work they were
doing, taking coffee breaks, cracking jokes <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> just like visiting any office staffed by
extremely talented and cool people.</p>
<p>In writing this, it was easy enough to call up Christiaan in Google Chat
to see if they still used Campfire. I got my answer, but I got something
else as well; affirmation. He suggested that he saw Google Wave
replacing a bunch of current tools <span
class="spCh spChx201c">“</span>wikis, blog, email, im<span
class="spCh spChx201d">”</span>.</p>

<p>I'm pasting this in here, with permission, because I want you to think
about how this workflow might change. I am writing this in a word
processor <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> and hopping out to the
web browser to look things up and paste in links, and if I want to ask
Christiaan a question then that happens over in another tab in the
browser and unless I make the connection like I did here, that
connection is lost. I'm very unlikely to remember the contribution he
made, and others commenting on this post before I publish it wouldn't
see it. In Wave, I'd simply invite him in to my draft document and the
chat could take place synchronously or asynchronously as we like. As it
is, I have to send him a copy of this document because he doesn't have
access to the private ADFI ICE system where I am going to seek comment
from others.</p>

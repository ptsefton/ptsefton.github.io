<p>As always, this blog is my opinion, and the stuff I write here is <span
class="spCh spChxa9">©</span> Peter Sefton. I'm emphasising this because
it is important to make the distinction here between what I personally
think and my role at USQ, and the <a href="http://cairss.caul.edu.au/">CAIRSS</a>
[update: fixed link thanks to @eric in comments] service we help provide
for CAUL. I would like to note in particular <strong>this</strong> post does not
represent the view of USQ or the Australian Digital Futures Institute
and is not written on behalf of CAIRSS. This is post is my personal
opinion.</p>
<p>I think that there is a gap in the market in the Australian Repository
scene; I think a lot of sites would be interested in services and/or
hosting around a completely open source software stack. In this post I
will outline the kinds of services I think might be attractive, how they
might be provisioned, which bits of software I think would be suitable.</p>
<p>I am writing this for three reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I see frustration in the repository community that needs to be
resolved. I've never used that phrase about the elephant in the room
before, but I can smell one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think that if it is resolved then my group at the Australian
Digital Futures Institute (ADFI) might be in a position to supply
some of the services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don't think that it is appropriate for ADFI or USQ to try to enter
the market as a service provider or I would not be posting this, I'd
be talking to our office of commercialisation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Regarding frustration: I have been at public meetings where people have
stood up and said quite explicitly that a particular piece of commercial
software is not working properly for them. I know that some of the sites
that use that software are shopping around for other solutions. I know
that at least one bought it but decided not to deploy it. I know that it
in the past it has been hard to upgrade between versions. I know it has
had performance and stability problems. And I have heard that it is very
hard to get it configured to work for the ERA. You, the customers know
who you are. My question is why don't you get together and (a) start
making some noise and (b) encourage a bit of open competition? Together
you represent an attractive market, with a set of similar repositories
that are sitting in a very open easy-to-migrate system, with a
dead-simple content model. If I was a customer I would be asking the
vendor to make the whole thing open source, so the community could fix
some of the bugs and/or seeing if there was a compatible open solution
with someone offering support <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> open
source means open market for services.</p>
<p>Which reminds me, where is the Australian Dorothea Salo, <a href="http://cavlec.yarinareth.net/">blogging from
a repository rat-hole</a> about what's
really going on with repositories and the software that drives them?
There's a gap in the blogospehere now that she's quit.</p>
<hr />
<h1><span id="id1"></span><!--id1--></a>The gap: commercial repository service on an open source base</h1>
</b>
I know there is at least a small market for services because USQ has
supplied such services to two small Higher-Education providers, helping
them to set up their ePrints repositories and assisting them with
sourcing a hosting provider. I know that there is a market for
commercially supported repository software because a significant number
of IRs in Australia are commercially supported. I don't know of anybody
actively developing and promoting a service which offers commercial
support for open software, something like Southampton offers for
ePrints. (You can get [support for
Fez](http://dev-repo.library.uq.edu.au/wiki/index.php/Fez_hosting_services),
apparently but as I write this the vendor is certainly not making it
easy to find that out on their site).
<p>So what I'd like to see is one or more providers set up shop offering
the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Training, consulting, maintenance, help-desk support and software
for running an IR where all the Software is open source.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hosting for institutions who don't want to do it themselves.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it. It's simple. Generally speaking there is no more inherent
risk in 'buying' a supported open source system than a closed one. In
some domains buying proprietary may get you lots more features <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> but I don't see that in this market.</p>
<p>As a library you could treat it like any other software deal, except
that at the end you not only get to keep the software, you can do what
you like with it, subject to the terms of the open source license. I
would imagine you would be looking at contact terms of something like 2
to 3 years to make this viable for the vendor.</p>
<hr />
<h1><span id="id2"></span><!--id2--></a>How would it work?</h1>
</b>
There are a few models for this that I can think of, I'm sure you can
think of more so use the comments below.
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Southampton/ePrints model, where the copyright holder for the
software offers services. I believe their business is going well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A third-party model, where someone just sets themselves up in
business <span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> the software is free
<span class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> away you go!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A hybrid model where one group does the training, deployment and
support work, while subcontracting development to the relevant
software owners. For example if you were offering support for
ePrints you might try to negotiate something with Southampton to
help fund the development of the product and resource bug-fixing
activities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>[Note that above I declared an interest in this idea <span
class="spCh spChx2013">–</span> I <strong>think</strong> my employer might be
interested in us doing some of the development and consulting in a model
like 2 or 3]</p>
<hr />
<h1><span id="id3"></span><!--id3--></a>Which repositories?</h1>
</b>
Based on a few years in this game, and running the technical team for
the RUBRIC project, If I were going to set up a 'classic' Institutional
Repository for the purposes of disseminating research via documents
produced by your researchers, then I would probably pick ePrints. It
works, it is stable and reliable, and it has all the workflow stuff you
need for managing an IR, and every time I poll my technical team they
agree. I think ePrints is less attractive for other stuff like photo
collections and so on, but they keep working on it.
<p>But of course the first phase for a potential vendor in this space would
be to work out which packages <strong>they</strong> were going to support.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you were going after existing ARROW customers then you'd go for
something that was compatible with their existing repositories,
which happen to be set up and running in Fedora and mostly using the
simple VALET system for ingest so you would probably look to keep
the Fedora stuff and maybe migrate to the new ARROW-funded version
of VALET, that my team helped write. I think that ePrints might be a
good choice for some of these sites for their core IR functions as
it vastly more configurable and usable than VALET, but that may be a
bit hard to swallow. I am predicting a version of ePrints with a
Fedora back-end, which might make people feel more comfortable about
it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you detected a need for DSpace support then that would be simple;
support DSpace unless those users are all looking to get into Fedora
in which case you can wait (probably a long time) to see if the new
DSpace/Fedora foundation builds you a hybrid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Like I said before I already <strong>know</strong> there is a market for ePrints
services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you wanted to take on Digital Commons or DigiTool, I'm not sure
what you'd do.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It has been a while since I have caught up with Fez and Muradora both of
which are alive and well, so you would want to consider those, at least.</p>
<p>But I don't think ePrints or any other IR is the whole story. I would
prefer to see a much more flexible discovery system over the top of the
IR. So if I were entering this market then I would also be pitching the
thing that is popping up everywhere in library systems these days,
Apache Solr.</p>
<p>For example, the NLA are testing a <a href="http://sbdsproto.nla.gov.au/sbdp-ui/">new Solr
system</a> across several data
sources.</p>
<p>With lots of libraries using Solr for their catalogues via applications
like VuFind I think Solr is a new standard bit of infrastructure which
is actually much more important to the customers than what you have on
the back-end. Who cares about DSpace vs Fedora vs ePritns when you can
mash it all up together and make it easy for people to create their own
view of the repository using a bit of Javascript embedded in a web page,
or a little site written using a rapid development framework like Django
or Rails.</p>
<p>Looking at our own situation, I think USQ should have a big fat Solr
index of their course materials, their Intranet, their IR, their data
(described using RIF-CS), feeds from their staff and student's
workblogs, delicious tagged-links, digital assets from the photography
department, etc. That doesn't mean it's all accessible to everyone, Solr
can use limit queries for security so that certain groups of people only
see certain things, as seen in <a href="http://fascinator.usq.edu.au/">The
Fascinator</a>which can act as a proxy in
front of Solr to handle security.</p>
<p>If there's any interest in seeing the kind of service offerings I think
would make sense spelled out in more detail let me know in the comments.</p>

<p>I will be attending <a href="http://openrepositories.org/">Open Repositories</a>
2007 (OR07), and will be showing-off
<a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/introduction/ice_rs.htm">ICE-RS</a>. It's on January
23-26, 2007 in San Antonio, Texas.</p>
<p>The conference organizers have granted me the opportunity to do a poster
presentation.</p>
<p>I'm disappointed that the abstract, included below, didn't please all
the reviewers. Two of them were enthusiastic, but the third obviously
doesn't see the value, mentioning that there are many other content
management systems apart from ICE. It's pretty hard to explain what ICE
does in a few paragraphs, because it's really more than a piece of
software. Anyway, I'm thinking that maybe I should have proposed a more
theoretical talk about why PDF-only document repositories are a bad idea
and what can be done about it.</p>
<p>There are indeed many other CMSs, but I have not found anything that has
the same distributed, version controlled, word-processor based, style
driven, multi-output capabilities as ICE, not to mention the dashboard
reporting and repository integration we're tackling with ICE-RS. And I'm
really sorry not to have the opportunity to talk about the issues in the
conference session; but I'll be there with a demo.</p>
<p>The abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Integrated Content Environment for Research and Scholarship:
helping move repositories from Web 0.5 to Web 2.0</strong></p>
<p>At Open Repositories 2006 there was lively discussion about bringing
repositories onto “Web 2.0”, a theme of Open Repositories 2007. Yet
many document repositories have not even made it to “Web 1.0”. For one
thing, the default document format for repositories is Adobe's
Portable Document Format, and many can not even serve HTML documents
and associated images. Thus many repositories are not really part of
the fabric of the Web.</p>
<p>While PDF has the advantage that it can faithfully render documents
for print it has a number of disadvantages; particularly in the areas
of online usability, re-use, re-rendering and re-mixing of content.
PDF should certainly be offered as a document format but so too should
HTML, allowing more seamless online scanning, browsing and reading and
better integration with the rest of the web via mechanisms such as
browser extensions.</p>
<p>In this paper we introduce a project, the Integrated Content
Environment for Research and Scholarship (ICE-RS) running from late
2006 until the end of 2007.</p>
<p>ICE-RS extends on an open source application (ICE) released by the
University of Southern Queensland in 2005. ICE is a system that allows
academic staff to work in a word processor using styles to capture the
structure of their work, while providing a parallel HTML view
generated automatically. Behind the scenes, documents are stored in
the OpenDocument Format, which promises to aid in preservation.</p>
<p>ICE-RS aims to provide a toolkit for researchers to enable them to
capture and manage content throughout its life cycle and create
flexible, re-mixable HTML and preservation-quality XML as well as PDF.
An example of re-mixing is the way ICE software can extract labeled
parts from a long document to make an HTML-formatted slide
presentation from key diagrams and specially marked-up text in the
document.</p>
<p>ICE-RS includes a 'working repository', a version-controlled,
distributed databased that can aggregate work from multiple
researchers, capturing research reporting from the very beginning of
its lifecycle, rather than just at the end, as is the case with most
Institutional Repositories.</p>
<p>The working repository will produce a 'dashboard' view of research in
progress, aggregating information about the writing process across
research teams and institutions. ICE-RS will collect metadata from the
very start of the writing process, and enable automated 'zero-click'
ingest into an IR at the appropriate time, for example upon acceptance
of a paper into a conference.</p>
<p>The ICE-RS project has established partnerships with other projects in
Australia for integration with DSpace and Fedora, and Fedora client
software including VTLS Vital and the University of Queensland's Fez.</p>
<p>This paper will report on accomplishments with ICE so far; and the
accompanying presentation will include a demonstration of the
software.</p>
<p>ICE-RS is supported by the Systemic Infrastructure Initiative as part
of the Commonwealth Government's Backing Australia's Ability - An
Innovative Action Plan for the Future

<h1> 
Does a text citation make a good persistent identifier? 
</h1>
<h2>2006-11-01 </h2>

<div>
<p>We've been talking about persistent identifiers at RUBRIC: how are
people going to name the things in their repository so they can be cited
and located in the future? We're looking to the  PILIN project (read a
presentation in
<a href="http://www.arrow.edu.au/docs/files/PILIN-IDEA-20061010.pdf">PDF</a> or
<a href="http://www.arrow.edu.au/docs/files/PILIN-IDEA-20061010.txt">text</a>) for
some advice. Expect to see more on this topic here over the next few
months.</p>
<p>Lots of repositories use <a href="http://www.handle.net/">Handles</a> to name
things and the handle infrastructure for naming things and storing
metadata about them is pretty impressive; but others, like USQ have yet
to buy-in and <a href="http://norman.walsh.name/2006/07/25/namesAndAddresses">some
people</a> think
that URIs are perfectly good names. Me, I'm still confused.</p>
<p>Anyway, a practical problem: how do you refer to an item in the <a href="http://eprints.usq.edu.au/">USQ
ePrints repository</a>?</p>
<p>How about a plain-text citation? This identifies something; it's a
perfectly good name.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Sefton, Peter (2006) The integrated content environment. In:
AusWeb06: The 12th Australasian World Wide Web Conference, 1-5 July
2006, Noosa, Australia.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My theory was that I could use Google as a resolver to find versions of
the paper by doing a phrase search but that doesn't work. The full
citation with the quotes yields nothing. Without the quotes Google takes
me to the ePrints <a href="http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00000697/">page</a>.
But
<a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=sfp&amp;p=Sefton%2C+Peter+(2006)+The+integrated+content+environment.+In%3A+AusWeb06%3A+The+12th+Australasian+World+W">Yahoo</a>
finds it using a phrase search. So does
<a href="http://search.ninemsn.com.au/results.aspx?q=%22Sefton%2C+Peter+(2006)+The+integrated+content+environment.+In%3A+AusWeb06%3A+The+12th+Australasian+World+Wide+Web+Conference%2C+1-5+July+2006%2C+Noosa%2C+Australia.%22&amp;geovar=70&amp;FORM=REDIR">MSN</a>.</p>
<p>USQ ePrints has a version of the paper in PDF format but the actual
paper is available from the conference web site in HTML format. As I
write this there's no link from ePrints to the version at the
conference; I'll see if I can get that added.</p>
<p>You can find the version of the paper at the conference web site by
searching  for AusWeb06, then clicking through the<a href="http://ausweb.scu.edu.au/aw06/papers/refereed/sefton/index.html">days of the
program</a>
(I was on Tuesday).</p>
<p>There is a also a paper version of the proceedings – so of course you
can <a href="http://nla.gov.au/anbd.bib-an000040588911">find that</a> via  the
National Library of Australia. (I searched to ausweb06). That finds the
proceedings of the conference: <em>AusWeb06 : Making a Difference with Web
Technologies / Treloar, Andrew(ed), Ellis, Allan(ed).</em> Maybe we could
update the ePrints repository to use this as part of the citation but if
we do that then the links in this post will eventually break – the
citation I used  in this post will no longer be there.</p>
<p>At this stage its looking like the plain text citation is not a
particularly good persistent name if you want automated resolution, but
on the other hand a human being can use it find the paper, and it should
work in a post-Internet world.</p>
<p>My understanding of handles is that you should be able to link all the
different versions of the paper by storing URLs as metadata against a
single name, the handle resolver service could be used to point to any
one of those versions, or you could make a service that threw up a page
where people could choose.</p>
<p>The handle could, in theory be like this (where n would be a number):
<code>1959.n/&quot;Sefton, Peter (2006) The integrated content environment. In: AusWeb06: The 12th Australasian World Wide Web Conference, 1-5 July 2006, Noosa, Australia.&quot;</code></p>
<p>Except that I have heard some people say that this kind of  local name
(that's the bit after the /) is a bad idea and names should be
meaningless. I don't understand that bit yet – maybe it's because of the
issue I noted above with the wording of the citation.</p>
<p>We're working through lots of practical issues to do with naming, citing
and locating things on the <a href="http://rubric.edu.au/">RUBRIC</a> and
<a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/introduction/ice_rs.htm">ICE-RS</a>projects – more
soon.</p>

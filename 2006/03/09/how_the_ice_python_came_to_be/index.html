How the ICE Python came to be 
</h1>
<h2>2006-03-09 </h2>

<div>
<p>I've been reading stuff on programming languages via Tim Bray's <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/03/05/Languages-Today">ongoing
site</a>.
I liked the pieces by Steve Yegge, who now chooses Ruby. What's more he
has a bike analogy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If languages are bicycles, then Awk is a pink kiddie bike with a white
basket and streamers coming off the handlebars, Perl is a beach
cruiser (remember how cool they were? Gosh.) and Ruby is a $7,500
titanium mountain bike. The leap from Perl to Ruby is as significant
as the leap from C++ to Java, but without any of the downside, because
Ruby's essentially a proper superset of Perl's functionality, whereas
Java took some things away that people missed, and didn't offer real
replacements for them.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cabochon.com/~stevey/blog-rants/tour-de-babel.html">http://www.cabochon.com/~stevey/blog-rants/tour-de-babel.html</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>(I have never ridden a $7,500 titanium mountain bike, but maybe I can
find out what it's like by writing some Ruby.)</p>
<p>I thought this might be a good time to talk about why we chose to write
the cross-platform publishing Integrated Content Environment (ICE) in
Python about a year ago.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We needed to integrate with OpenOffice.org which ships with Python
built-in, so there's likely to be lots of example of Python code to
draw on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While we had a team well qualified and practiced with Java, none of
us had any confidence that we could get a cross platform Java
application to run correctly. I couldn't get simple applets written
by the USQ team to run in Firefox at the time and I simply dreaded
having to go to Sun's site to download Java! Which one do I need?
JDK, JRE who knows? And how do I run a Java thing I've downloaded?
Classpath? What?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Python allows us to compile stand-alone applications for Windows and
OS X.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://chandler.osafoundation.org/">Chandler</a>, the new Ã¼ber
Personal Information Manager project is using Python. The OSAF team
did their homework and bet on Python. And ICE was aimed at a similar
community, starting with Higher Education just like Chandler. One
day ICE, or part of it may even become a Chandler module.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Python is a good language</strong>, mostly consistent and easy to test. I
think that Python's whitespace makes for readable, more consistent
code, It bypasses the need to document at least some aspects of a
coding standard.</p>
<p>We use <a href="http://codespeak.net/py/current/doc/test.html">py.test</a> for
our unit test framework, in addition to
<a href="https://utf-x.dev.java.net/">UTF-X</a> for testing XSLT.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Some things are less than ideal.</p>
<p>Python has pretty feeble native XML support, lacking the crucial XPath
and XSLT out of the box. We use <a href="http://xmlsoft.org/">libxml2 and
libsxtl</a>, which work in not very Pythonic way but
get the job done.</p>
<p>But why not Ruby, and possibly Rails?</p>
<p>Ruby's profile a year ago was nothing like it is now so we didn't really
consider it. I think if we were to start ICE now, it would be worth a
look. It <strong>can</strong> be <a href="http://www.erikveen.dds.nl/rubyscript2exe/index.html">compiled into stand-alone
executables</a> just
like Python. There would be lots of work to do, though to find out about
subversion libraries and OpenOffice.org integration.</p>

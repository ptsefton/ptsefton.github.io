<p>Simon Phipps
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/webmink/entry/birthday_presents">writes</a> about a
new $13.18 (that's Australian dollars) plugin for OpenOffice.org and
StarOffice that purports to be a weblog editor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In our first venture to fund Sun's OpenOffice.org developers through
an add-on product, we've released Sun Weblog Publisher, a plug-in for
OpenOffice.org or StarOffice 8 that turns it into a full-featured blog
editor. At only $9.95 it's exceptional value, and it directly
supports our efforts to keep OpenOffice.org development rolling.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.sun.com/webmink/entry/birthday_presents">http://blogs.sun.com/webmink/entry/birthday_presents</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have tried it out but I can't recommend it.</p>
<p>I normally wouldn't buy a bit of software that I don't need, with no
free trial, but I just had to try it, 'cos I've been wanting to see the
issue of HTML export from OpenOffice.org addressed properly. I don't
expect this to actually work for anything except plain paragraphs, for
reasons <a href="http://del.icio.us/ptsefton/ptsefton+wpinterop">discussed here</a>
many times before but I thought I should prove the point. Except that I
can't prove it 'cos I can't post with it to see how it works.</p>
<p>First up, I went and set up an account at
<a href="http://ptsefton.wordpress.com/">http://ptsefton.wordpress.com</a>. That
was easy.</p>
<p>Buying the software from Sun was a bit harder – I accidentally clicked
something that said 'check' beneath my credit card details – turned out
that meant I wanted to pay by cheque – only I didn't and there was no
way to uncheck all the payment options I didn't want, so I ended up with
an extra order I don't intend to pay for.</p>
<p>It's not supposed to work on Mac OS X in NeoOffice but it installs OK
and it made a connection to ptsefton.wordpress.com  once I realised that
I had to go into the settings in NeoOffice and tell it not to use a web
proxy (choose None rather than System).</p>
<p>I wrote some text.</p>
<p>Then I looked around for preview button to see what the HTML was going
to be like. Nope.</p>
<p>Tried to publish and discovered that it won't connect to Wordpress.com
any more. I can get a sort-of connection to the server, it seems, by
turning on and off the proxy but I can't post. Half an hour of that was
enough, so I headed off to Blogger to try my luck with an account there.
That wouldn't work either, same complaint from the software:</p>
<p><span
id="graphics1"></span><img src="1.png" alt="graphics1"></p>
<p>Then I tried:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Connecting to the university network via VPN and configuring a proxy
server in NeoOffice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changing my Wordpress password.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The X11 version of OpenOffice.org on the Mac (also not supposed to
work and I can confirm that it doesn't. It won't install properly.).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Windows version of OpenOffice.org on the PC at home (2.0.4 on XP
SP2) which is supposed to work. Same symptoms as NeoOffice, mostly,
only worse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All of the above with the Bogger account.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>No luck.</p>
<p>And the site says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no product support for Sun Weblog Publisher. If you have
feedback about the product you can email them to
Weblog-Publisher-feedback@sun.com</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'll do that.</p>

<p>The most popular page ever on this site, by far, is the <a href="http://ptsefton.com/blog/2006/02/07/new_bike:_trek_520">one about my
Trek 520</a>
touring bike which I bought in Toowoomba, in Australia, where I live.</p>
<p>Here it is – on my feral driveway.</p>
<p><span
id="graphics1"></span><img src="1.png" alt="graphics1"></p>
<p>A couple of regular readers were annoyed that I strayed from the normal
fare of word processing and XML but it brings me a steady stream of
Googlers. I might figure out how to start up separate feeds for
technical posts and cycling posts. Maybe. Anyway, there will be a couple
more cycling posts coming soon. We have a new bike in the shed that I
<strong>need</strong> to talk about.</p>
<p>One of the nice things about posting about the Trek 520 was meeting one
Simon Troman online. He emailed me with some advice about the numb toes
I was getting from the <a href="http://specialized.com/bc/SBCEqProduct.jsp?spid=12749">Specialized Body Geometry Comp MTB
shoes</a>.</p>
<p>Simon suggested that this might be due to soft soles, causing the shoe
to flex over the pedal. Not in this case – my shoes are very stiff.
Subsequent discussion suggests I should try moving the cleats back a
bit. I haven't tried that yet. I have a feeling my toes might hit the
mudguard (fender) if I do. But with thick socks in winter I have not
been doing the shoes up as tightly as I did in summer with no socks and
I'm having fewer problems with the toes.</p>
<p>Simon works for a Canberra bike shop part time. I've never been there,
but based on Simon's willingness to help me out over the net I'd
recommend a visit if you happen to be shopping for a bike in Canberra.
Try <a href="http://ww2.whereis.com/mapping/geocodeAddress.do?streetNumber=7&amp;streetName=Sargood&amp;streetType=St&amp;locality=O&amp;state=ACT&amp;placeName=Bike%20Culture&amp;address=7%20Sargood%20St%20O&amp;phoneNumber=(02)%206262%209233&amp;link=1155188163035&amp;hashCode=146313432242024&amp;brandId=5">Bike Culture in
O’Connor</a>.
They can sell you a Trek, I gather.</p>
<p>Anyway, at around 7 months of age the bike has now done 2000km, mostly
on the home, school, work, shops, home run so I thought I'd give an
update.</p>
<p>Everything still works, as you'd expect from a decent bit of machinery.
In contrast, the $340 Apollo mountain bike that preceded it was was
starting to show its age after this kind of mileage with gears not
shifting properly and brakes a bit funny, not to mention the broken back
axle (but then it was carrying me and a 20kg kid 15km per day 3 days a
week).</p>
<p>The Trek 520 doesn't look new anymore – there are a few scuffs on the
frame from bike racks, and collisions with children and the like.</p>
<p>A few minor issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Handlebar tape is getting a bit uneven – maybe this is normal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mudguard is a bit bent. This is due to the impact of an enthusiastic
six-year-old on the way home from school in <a href="http://tcc.toowoomba.qld.gov.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=236&amp;Itemid=166">Queen's Park Gardens,
formerly known as the botanic
gardens</a>.
I said “You know I'm riding beside you, don't you ...”. We tangled
on the “you”. Nobody was seriously hurt. He got a good jab from the
end of the drop handlebar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Went through the first set of front brake pads (right down to the
metal) in 1500km. The guys at <a href="http://www.bikeline.com.au/">Bikeline in
Toowoomba</a> were astounded, as I don't
do that much seriously downhill riding, but I worked out that it was
from riding with my kids. I come home from school, about 1km, with
brakes on just about all the way a few times a week. And maybe I'm a
bit timid on some of the other downhill pitches around Toowoomba.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the little plastic covers fell off one of the STI gear/brake
levers. It appears to serve no function anyway, except maybe
micro-aerodynamics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Bontranger Race Lite (700x32) tyres are really hard to get off
and on the rim. I found this out when I broke the valve on the front
tyre (more than once) because I only had a hand pump. Then I broke
the plastic tyre levers I bought when I got the bike. Then the tyre
would not seat properly until I got a real pump and pumped it up to
110psi.</p>
<p>Kids, get a proper floor pump with a pressure guage. It was amazing
how far under the recommended pressure <strong>all</strong> our bikes were.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And those tyres are a bit slippery in the wet. Not that it rains
much here, but when it did a couple of weeks ago I had a couple of
little wobbles. I assume a bit of practice would be needed to know
how far they can be pushed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then I got my first puncture, and in the process of replacing the
tube I:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Blew up a tube with a spectacular gunshot-like crack at about
100psi while I was pumping. I assume it was pinched somewhere.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bent the lip of the rim outwards presumably with tyre levers. I
bent it back in with a hammer and a pair of pliers, as per the
instructions
<a href="http://www.bikewebsite.com/bicycle-wheel-straightening2.htm">here</a>.
It's pretty straight now, but I had to adjust the brake pads to
clear the wobbly bit.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Next step is to buy a trailer, to make trips to the markets,
supermarket, nursery, hardware store, and picnics  a bit easier. True, I
can put a whole box of apples on the front rack of the Apollo. And a big
load of veges in the back panniers. And more in a backpack. But a
trailer would be simpler. And I could hitch it to the 520.</p>
<p>I like the look of the <a href="http://www.chainringtransitauthority.com/store/shopper/shopper.shtml">BicyleR Evolution
trailers.</a>
I have no desire to have  an
